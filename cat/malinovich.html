  <p>This study of Jewish cultural innovation in early  twentieth-century France  highlights the complexity and ambivalence of Jewish identity and  self-definition in the modern world. This stimulating and original book makes a  major contribution to our understanding of modern Jewish history as well as to the  history of the Jews in France  and to the larger discourse about modern Jewish identities.</p>

      <p>&lsquo;<em>Well written, thoroughly researched, and engaging . . . It is the  first systematic consideration of what the renaissance of French Jewish culture  actually was, and the combination of social history and cultural studies is  deftly handled; this is not just a study of &eacute;lites and their ideas. The  approach to the cultural influence of Zionism is particularly nuanced, and the  case for the development in this period of an openly ethnic component to French  Jewish identity is effectively argued . . . contributes to French as well as French  Jewish history while also consciously participating in a larger discourse about  Jewish identity in the modern world.</em>&rsquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
        Paula E. Hyman, <strong>Yale University</strong></p>
      <p>This study of Jewish cultural innovation in early  twentieth-century France  highlights the complexity and ambivalence of Jewish identity and self-definition  in the modern world.</p>
      <p>Following the Dreyfus affair, French Jews increasingly began to  question how Jewishness should be defined in a society where Jews enjoyed full  political equality. Writers who had previously not given voice to their Jewish  origins began to explore biblical themes, traditional Jewish folklore, and  issues of identity and assimilation. A plethora of new journals focusing on  Jewish religion, history, and culture came into being, as did a multitude of  associations--literary societies, youth groups, religious organizations-- that  emphasized Jewish distinctiveness <br />
        <br />
        Nadia Malinovich explores this blossoming of Jewish cultural life in France,  often described by contemporaries as a Jewish &lsquo;renaissance&rsquo; or &lsquo;awakening&rsquo;.  Describing and analysing the emergence of new forms of Jewish associational  life, she shows that the interface between the various groups was as important  as the differences between them: it was the process of debate and dialogue that  infused new energy into French Jewish identity and culture. She similarly  analyses the Jewish press and literature to develop a typology of themes,  providing a panoramic view of how Jewish identity and culture were discussed  and debated among Jews and non-Jews of varying ideological, cultural, and  political orientations. Her analysis also provides a vantage point from which  to explore the complex ways in which French national identity was re-negotiated  in the early twentieth century. During this period, French Jews in effect  reshaped the category of Frenchness itself, and in so doing created new  possibilities for being both French and Jewish.<br />
  <br />
        This is a stimulating and original book that makes a major contribution to our  understanding of modern Jewish history as well as to the history of the Jews in  France  and to the larger discourse about Jewish identities in the modern world.</p>

          <p><em>'An important contribution . . . In  terms of research Malinovich has brought together a large body of material and  displays impressive, intimate knowledge of both literary and organizational  sources. She also does an admirable job of tying these sources to the larger  context of Jewish and French history . . . Nadia Malinovich has provided vital  information to scholars wishing to trace the development and boundaries of  Jewish identity in France. By illuminating a period that has escaped recent  scholarly attention, she enhances our ability to understand the broader  contours of French Jewish Society.'</em><br />
          Jeffrey Haus, <strong>H-French</strong></p>
<p><em>'Illuminating . . . well researched, persuasively argued,  and thought-provoking. Scholars of the Jews of France and of modern Jewish  history more broadly should read it with great interest for years to  come.'</em><br />
          Ethan Katz, <strong>H-Judaic</strong></p>
          <p><em>'Does much to right a wrong-headed view of French Jewry  as a community always under siege.' </em><br />
Michell Abidor,<strong> Jewish Currents</strong></p>
          <p><em>'Rich discussion of Zionist, religious, and other  cultural formulations.' </em><br />
          Sanford Gutman, <strong>Shofar</strong></p>
          <p><em>'Insightful . . . thoughtful . . . Perhaps  future works, building on the literature that Malinovich has significantly  enriched will be in a position to address the Jewish renaissance of the  interwar years from a wider transnational perspective.'</em> Ari Joskowicz, <strong>Studies  in Contemporary Jewry</strong></p>

          <p>The First World War  was a major watershed in modern Jewish history. Out of it came the Balfour  Declaration, a first critical step in the creation of the State of Israel, but  also a radical redrafting of the political map of eastern and central Europe,  with dramatic and potentially tragic consequences for its dispersed but  substantial Jewish minority.</p>
          <p>In this lucid work,  which was awarded the 1991 Fraenkel Prize for Contemporary History, Mark Levene  approaches these developments through the diplomatic endeavours of Lucien Wolf,  a British Jew who was both one of the chief exponents of the Balfour  Declaration and as co-architect of the Minorities Treaty that provided an  internationally endorsed framework for Jewish existence in Europe after World  War I. Through an analysis of Wolf's diplomacy, Levene examines how Jewish  interests throughout Europe were affected by the Great War and how they were  perceived by the warring powers.</p>
          <p>Levene shows how  british support for Zionism was bound up with misconceptions about the Jewish  role in Europe, notably that the revolutionary movement in Russia was  Jewish-inspired and Jewish-led. Equally, however, he shows how the diplomatic  activities of Wolf and his Jewish contemporaries heralded the entry of 'world  Jewry' as a perceived force in modern politics, and how Wolf himself was  preoccupied with eastern Europe and its jews at a precarious time. He also  analyses how the war affected Jewish political self-perceptions, reviewing the  context between assimilationists and Zionists in the broader framework of war,  peace, and international diplomacy. His consideration of their conflicting claims  says much that is of relevance to the contemporary discussion of Zionism as  well as to the problems of ethnic and religious minorities in nation-states.</p>

          <p>'<em>A book of the first  importance and of great originality . . . a remarkable achievement.</em>'&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
Max Beloff</p>
          <p>'<em>An academic work of  immense knowledge and scholarship. It is recommended as a well-written, highly  detailed, and accurate assessment of the diplomacy of Lucien Wolf.</em>'&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
            Baron Frankal</p>
          <p>'<em>Impressive . . . has  implications well beyond the exploration of one man's diplomatic activity on  behalf of British and British-Jewish interests . . . Levene demonstrates  brilliantly that Wolf was a pragmatist with formidable intellectual resilience  . . . richly detailed, but most readable work</em>.'&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
            David Cesarani, <strong>Jewish Chronicle</strong></p>
          <p><em>'Illuminates a  critical episode in an unconventional discipline, pre-1948 Jewish diplomatic  history. Herein lies the great strength of the book: Levene does not treat his  subject like a normative segment of diplomatic history; he is sensitive to the  facts that there was no army or government backing up Wolf, and that any impact  he might possibly have made must be seen as extraordinary . . . Levene achieves  an impressive critical distance from his subject, and this will possibly place  his work among the more authoritative interpretations in the long run . . .  superb study . . . Levene's research and judgments are meticulous without being  pedantic . . . an immensely valuable book, which will be of interest to  scholars in Anglo-Jewish history, east European Jewish history and politics,  Zionist history, diplomatic history, and those interested in the eternally grey  zone between peoples, ethnic groups, and publicly recognized nations while the  world is crashing down.'&nbsp;&nbsp; </em><br />

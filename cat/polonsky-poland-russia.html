<p>Shortlisted for the 2015 Jewish Quarterly-Wingate Literary Prize</p>
          <p>For  many centuries Poland and Russia formed the heartland of the Jewish  world: right up to the Second World War the area was home to over 40  per cent of the world's Jews. Nearly three and a half million Jews  lived in Poland alone, with nearly three million more in the Soviet  Union. Yet although the majority of the Jews of Europe and the United  States, and a large proportion of the Jews of Israel, originate from  these lands, and many of  the major movements that  have characterized the Jewish world in recent times have their  origins there, the history of their Jewish communities is not  well known. Rather, it is the subject of mythologizing  that fails both to bring out the specific features of the Jewish  civilization that emerged there and to illustrate what was lost in  its destruction: Jewish life in these parts, though often poor  materially, was marked by a high degree of spiritual and ideological intensity  and creativity. Antony Polonsky re-creates this lost world—brutally  cut down by the Holocaust and seriously damaged by the Soviet attempt  to destroy Jewish culture—in a study that avoids both  sentimentalism and the simplification of the east European Jewish  experience into a story of persecution and martyrdom. </p>

          <p>It  is an important story whose relevance reaches far beyond the Jewish  world or the bounds of east-central Europe, and Professor Polonsky  succeeds in providing a comprehensive overview that highlights the  realities of Jewish life while also setting them in the context of  the political, economic, and social realities of the time. He  describes not only the towns and shtetls where the Jews lived, the  institutions they developed, and their participation in the economy,  but also their vibrant religious and intellectual life, including the  emergence of hasidism and the growth of opposition to it from within  the Jewish world. By the late eighteenth century other factors had  come into play: with the onset of modernization there were government  attempts to integrate and transform the Jews, and the stirrings of  Enlightenment led to the growth of the Haskalah movement that was to  revolutionize the Jewish world. Polonsky looks at developments in  each area in turn: the problems of emancipation, acculturation, and  assimilation in Prussian and Austrian Poland; the politics of  integration in the Kingdom of Poland; and the failure of forced  integration in the tsarist empire. He then shows how the  deterioration of the position of the Jews between 1881 and 1914  encouraged a range of new movements—Zionism, socialism, and  autonomism—as well as the emergence of modern Hebrew and Yiddish  literature. He also examines Jewish urbanization and the rise of  Jewish mass culture. </p>

          <p>The  final part of the volume deals with the twentieth century. Starting  from the First World War and the establishment of the Soviet Union,  it looks in turn at Poland, Lithuania, and the Soviet Union up to the  Second World War. It then reviews Polish–Jewish relations during  the war and examines the Soviet record in relation to the Holocaust.  The final chapters deal with the Jews in the Soviet Union and in  Poland since 1945, concluding with an epilogue on the Jews in Poland,  Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine, and Russia since the collapse of  communism.</p>

          <p> This  is an abridged version of a three-volume hardback edition which won  the 2011 Kulczycki Book Prize for Polish Studies (awarded by the  American Association for Slavic, East European, and Eurasian Studies)  and also the Pro Historia Polonorum Prize for the best book on the  history of Poland published in a foreign language between 2007 and  2011 (a prize established by the Polish Senate and awarded by the  Polish Historical Association).</p>

        <div class="CollapsiblePanelContent">

          <p><em>‘An invaluable research resource with maps, tables, endnotes, statistics, glossary, and bibliography. It also delivers a compelling picture and credible picture of how Jews responded to dramatic change . . . does well to focus on women, whom previous histories often ignore.’</em> <br />
          Lawrence Joffe, <strong>Jewish Chronicle</strong></p>
          <p><em>'Remarkable for its scale and ambition . . . Polonsky manages to combine great themes with fascinating detail . . . [he] has read widely in numerous languages. The erudition is impressive . . . extremely judicious in negotiating a number of notorious historiographical minefields . . . makes important distinctions between different countries in eastern Europe and consequently the different experience of the Jews . . . a magnificent, scholarly work, clearly written, with a magisterial overview of its subject.' </em><br />
          David Herman,<strong> Jewish Renaissance</strong></p>
          <p>From  reviews of <em>The Jews in Poland and Russia, Volumes 1–3</em>:</p>

          <p><em>'Exemplary  and formidable . . . Polonsky, as much as anyone else, has created  the field of modern Jewish history as a subject to be considered and  understood rather than simply a tragic past to be mourned. He is too  good a historian to confuse the history of Jewish life with the  German policies that brought Jewish death . . . The barely visible  commitment in these three wonderful volumes is to rescue a world from  polemic, for the sake of history.</em>'<br />
          Timothy Snyder, <strong>Wall  Street Journal</strong></p>

          <p> <em>'We  can only commend Antony Polonsky for his massive effort to explain  seven centuries of Jewish history . . . [his] strength lies in his  ability to illuminate intellectual and cultural developments . . .  Because of the excellent bibliographies, extensive annotation, and  wonderful maps . . . any reader wishing to read in greater detail  about Polish and Russian Jewry will have plenty of resources to  enable the search.' </em><br />
          Alexandra S. Korros, <strong>Jewish Quarterly</strong></p>

          <p><em>'Masterful  . . . In Polonsky's erudite and eminently clear treatment, the rich  forest of eastern European Jewish civilization that has become  obscured not only by trees, but also by debris of scholarly twigs,  re-emerges in its full lushness . . . The Judaic studies academy will  long be in Polonsky's debt for this sweeping work, one destined to be  the authoritative classic in its field for the foreseeable future.'</em><br />
          Allan Nadler, <strong>Forward</strong>          </p>
          <p><em>'Definitive  . . . The scope is immense and the author does an impressive job of  synthesizing a vast literature . . . This trilogy will no doubt serve  as a standard history of east European Jewry for a long time.'    </em><br />
          Shaul Stampfer, <strong>Religious  Studies Review</strong></p>

          <p><em>'Well-researched,  well-written . . . a comprehensive survey . . . highly recommended.'</em><br />
          S. Kan, <strong>Choice</strong></p>
          <p><em>'Stupendous'</em> <br />
          David Frum, <strong>The Daily Beast</strong></p>

          <p><em>'The  most important thing one can say about Antony Polonsky's The  Jews in Poland and Russia is: get it and read it!</em>' <br />
          Theodore R. Weeks, <strong>The  Polish Review</strong></p>

          <p><em>'Magisterial,  comprehensive . . . a highly original and distinctive contribution to  the fields of east European as well as Jewish history . . . an  authoritative reference for research and teaching . . . an eloquent  and refreshing narrative and compelling analysis . . . overwhelming  keen judgement, deep knowledge of Poland and its Jews, and remarkable  critical insights that are manifest in this extraordinary book.'</em><br />

<p>Women are conspicuously absent from the Jewish mystical tradition. Only  the Sabbatian movement, with its  unprecedented female liberationist, egalitarian agenda, acknowledged women&rsquo;s  spiritual inspiration and invested them with authority. It abandoned the  halakhic norms governing relations between the sexes, turned the messiah's wife  into his full consort, and generated a syncretistic cult of the &lsquo;holy maiden&rsquo;  venerated as female messiah. A fascinating study&nbsp;of an early-modern  movement&nbsp;that transcended traditional gender paradigms.      </p>

          <p>Women are conspicuously absent from the Jewish mystical tradition. Even  if historically some Jewish women may have experienced mystical revelations and  led richly productive spiritual lives, the tradition does not preserve any  record of their experiences or insights. Only the chance survival of scant  evidence suggests that, at various times and places, individual Jewish women  did pursue the&nbsp;path of mystical piety or prophetic spirituality, but it  appears that they were generally censured, and efforts were made to suppress  their activities. This contrasts sharply with the fully acknowledged prominence  of women in the mystical traditions of both Christianity and Islam.</p>
          <p>It is against this background that the mystical messianic movement  centred on the personality of Sabbatai Zevi (1626-76) stands out as a unique  and remarkable exception. Sabbatai Zevi addressed to women a highly original  liberationist message, proclaiming that he had come to make them &lsquo;happy as men&rsquo;  by releasing them from the pangs of childbirth and the subjugation to their  husbands that were ordained for women as a consequence of the primordial sin.  This unprecedented redemptive vision became an integral part of Sabbatian  eschatology, which the messianists believed to be unfolding and experienced in  the present.&nbsp;Their New Law, superseding the Old with the dawning of the  messianic era, overturned the traditional halakhic norms that distinguished and  regulated relations between the sexes. This was expressed not only in the  outlandish ritual transgression of sexual prohibitions, in which the Sabbatian  women were notoriously implicated, but also in the apparent adoption of the  idea&mdash;totally alien to rabbinic Judaism&mdash;that virginity, celibacy, or sexual  abstinence were conducive to women&acute;s spiritual empowerment.</p>
          <p>Ada  Rapoport-Albert&nbsp;traces the diverse manifestations of this vision in every  phase of Sabbatianism and its offshoots.  These include the early promotion of women to centre-stage as messianic  prophetesses;&nbsp;their independent affiliation with the movement in their own  right; their initiation in the esoteric teachings of the kabbalah; and their  full incorporation, on a par with men, into the ritual and devotional life of  the messianic community.&nbsp;Their investment with authority was such as to  elevate the messiah&acute;s wife (a figure&nbsp;mostly absent from traditional  messianic speculations) to the rank of full messianic consort, sharing in her  husband&acute;s redemptive mission as well as his divine dimension. By the late  eighteenth century, a syncretistic cult&nbsp;had developed that recognized in  Eva&mdash;the unmarried daughter of Jacob Frank, one of Sabbatai Zevi&acute;s apostate  messianic successors&mdash;an incarnate female aspect of the kabbalistic godhead,  worshipped as `Holy Virgin&acute; and female messiah by her father&rsquo;s  devotees.&nbsp;This was the culmination of the Sabbatian  endeavour to transcend the traditional gender paradigm that  had&nbsp;excluded women from the public arena of Jewish spiritual life.</p>

    <p><em>‘Impressive.’   </em><br />
      Joshua Schwartz, <strong>Ancient Traditions, New Conversations</strong> (Yeshiva University Law School blog)</p>
    <p><em>'</em><em>An important work in the hisory of Sabbatianism and Jewish  Women's studies. Highly recommended.'</em><br />
      Daniel Schiede, <strong>Association of  Jewish Libraries Review</strong></p>
    <p><em>'To be congratulated for demonstrating  that Jewish messianic mysticism, far from being an arcane scholarly domain of  interest only to textual specialists, is a topic of key significance to anyone  interested in the processes through which the corporatist boundaries of  eighteenth-century European society travelled.'</em><br />
Adam Sutcliffe, <strong>Eighteenth-Century  Studies</strong></p>
<p><em>'A breakthrough in this field, interpreting previously known sources in a way that sets up new research areas that have been overlooked or ignored . . . a thorough analysis of sources. It is very well documented and very inspiring. The book should not only be studied by those who are interested in Sabbatianism and gender studies, but also those interested in the historical study of religion, ideology, and ideas.'</em><br />
      Michał Galas, <strong>H-Judaic</strong></p>
<p><em>'A book of importance for all  those interested in gender issues related to Jews and Judaism, as well as for  those engaged in the study of Jewish mysticism. It further challenges people  engaged in the study of Jews and Judaism in the early modern period to pay  careful attention to the ways in which Sabbatian believers influenced  historical developments both in direct and dialectical ways.'</em><br />
  Ira  Robinson, <strong>IsraBlog: Canadian Institute for  Jewish Research</strong></p>
<p><em>'A fascinating book . . .  Rapoport-Albert shows with great scholarly detail that women were actively  involved in the Sabbatian movement . . . Some of the details in this volume are  startling, but the work opens up an intriguing and valuable window to the  status of women in east European Jewish life.'</em><br />
  <strong>Jewish Orthodox Feminist Alliance  Journa</strong></p>
<p><em>'Exhaustively researched and  brilliantly written . . . One aspect of Frankism on which Rapoport-Albert is  especially good is the peculiar tension between sexual libertinism and  asceticism.'</em><br />
  David Biale, <strong>Jewish Review of Books</strong></p>
<p><em>'Not only breaks down many stereotypes about the roles of women  in Judaism and Jewish society, but it is also a major contribution to  understanding how Sabbatianism and Frankism spread and operated . . . rich in  original ideas and insights. While many of the topics call for further  research, the rich documentation Rapoport-Albert brings to bear on the topics  leave little room for doubt that a call for changed gender roles, to a greater  or lesser degree, was a central element in the Sabbatian and Frankist  movements. It is a very stimulating contribution to the literature on Kabbalah,  on modern religious movements, on gender history, as well as on conservative  responses.'</em><br />

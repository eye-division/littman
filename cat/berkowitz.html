        <span class="author">Edited by Joel Berkowitz</span>      </p>
    <p>This
        collection of essays conveys a broad range of fundamental ideas about
        Yiddish theatre and its importance in Jewish life as a reflection of aesthetic,
        social, and political trends and concerns. The contributions cover such
        topics as the Yiddish repertoire, including the purimshpil and the relationship
        between Yiddish drama and the broader European dramatic tradition; the
        historiography of the Yiddish theatre; the role of music; censorship,
        both by governmental authorities and from within the Jewish community;
        and the politics of Yiddish theatre criticism. Taken as a whole, these
        essays make a significant contribution to our understanding of Jewish
    literature and culture in eastern Europe and the United States.</p>

          <p><em>'A stimulating and encouraging book that I am happy to recommend to the specialist and the curious reader alike . . . It is not only a politically opportune moment to investigate the history of Yiddish theatre . . . but also a time to create a comprehensive study of Jewish theatre.'</em><br />
Yana Meerzon, <strong>Modern Language Review</strong></p>
          <p><em>'Carefully and lovingly edited . . . represents a genuinely heroic effort at elevating a genre . . . The scholarship is impeccable, and the contributors all serious scholars.' </em><br />
            S. Gittleman, <strong>Choice</strong></p>
          <p>This volume of essays is the first collection of scholarly studies on the Yiddish
            theatre to appear in English. Drawing on a variety of academic disciplines,
            it considers the dramatic and musical repertoire of Yiddish theatre and their
            historical development, popular and critical reception of productions, and the
            practice and consequences of state censorship. The time-span covered is broad&#8212;from
            the Middle Ages to the twentieth century&#8212;as is the geographical range:
            Cracow, London, Moscow, New York, St Petersburg, Vienna, and Warsaw. <em>The
              Yiddish Theatre</em> not only presents a comprehensive study of the field but
            also helps illustrate the significance of the Yiddish theatre as a vital form
            of expression in the Jewish world. Yiddish drama and theatre has had an enormous
            capacity to entertain audiences on six continents, while at the same time highlighting
            social, political, religious, and economic concerns of vital interest to the
            Jewish people.</p>
          <p><em>The Yiddish Theatre</em> is a valuable resource for scholars, university
            students, and general readers interested both in Yiddish theatre specifically
            and related fields such as Jewish literature and culture, east European history
            and culture, and European and American theatre. The book contains the most comprehensive
            bibliography to date of sources relating to the Yiddish theatre.</p>

          <p><em>'A comprehensive study of the field . . . a wonderful read . . . A valuable resource for any person interested in the history of the Yiddish theatre, or anyone interested in Jewish literature and culture, or anyone interested in the history of theatre in general in eastern Europe and America.'</em><br />
          Sara Marcus, <strong>AJL Newsletter</strong></p>
          <p><em>'There is nothing comparable in English . . . it is a pioneering volume that necessarily lays a foundation and implies an agenda for Yiddish theatre scholarship in the English-speaking world. Because it is the first and as yet only such publication in English, it will repay careful scrutiny in its parts and as a whole.' </em><br />
            Michael C. Steinlauf, <strong>All about Jewish Theatre</strong></p>
          <p><em>'Carefully and lovingly edited . . . represents a genuinely heroic effort at elevating a genre . . . The scholarship is impeccable, and the contributors all serious scholars.' </em><br />

          <p>'The   volume contains eleven excellent articles and has been produced by a publisher   of repute: the Littman Library . . . All in all, <em>Yiddish Theatre: New   Approaches</em> is a landmark in the field of Yiddish cultural history. It is a   thought-provoking book, which will hopefully inspire new collective volumes and   monographs.'<br />

            Michael Steinlauf, <strong>Modern Jewish Studies</strong></p>
          <p><em>'A stimulating and encouraging book that I am happy to recommend to the specialist and the curious reader alike . . . It is not only a politically opportune moment to investigate the history of Yiddish theatre . . . but also a time to create a comprehensive study of Jewish theatre, comparable to what has been done in publications on the history and traditions of Jewish film. It is a pleasure to acknowledge that Yiddish Theatre: New Approaches constitutes a very effective step in this direction.'</em><br />
            Yana Meerzon, <strong>Modern Language Review</strong><br />
          </p>
          <p><em>'Aside of the high level of papers there are many extra advantages of the book: selection of interesting plates and tables, many interesting texts (written in transcription for the sake of those not knowing Hebrew . . .), and above all detailed bibliography (34 pages) and thorough index.'</em><br />
            Przemyslaw Piekarski, <strong>Scripta Judaica Cracoviensia</strong></p>
          <p><em>'One the book's best attributes is the ability of its   contributors to place their subjects within larger European contexts . . . the   calibre of the contributions is high, demonstrating the degree to which Yiddish   theatre is attracting the attention of serious scholars . . . [the book]   succeeds not only in its goal of presenting some of the most important new   scholarship on Yiddish theatre, but more importantly in helping to bring the   study of this integral component of Jewish culture into wider academic circles   and into a more complex scholarly discourse.' &nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br />

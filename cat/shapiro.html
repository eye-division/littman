      <p>Compellingly and authoritatively written, this biography illuminates
        the dilemmas that Europe's Jews have faced over the past century. The
        discussion of the inner struggles of one of twentieth-century Judaism's
        most enigmatic religious leaders-a figure who became a central ideologue
        of modern Orthodoxy despite his traditional training in a Lithuanian yeshiva-elucidates
        many institutional and intellectual phenomena of the Jewish world, and
        especially in pre-war Europe, that have so far received little attention.</p>

            Gershon Bacon, <strong>Studies in Contemporary Jewry</strong></p>
          <p>The span of Rabbi Jehiel Jacob Weinberg's life (1884-1966) illuminates the
            religious and intellectual dilemmas that traditional Jewry has faced over the
            past century. Rabbi Weinberg became a central ideologue of modern Orthodoxy
            because of his positive attitude to secular studies and Zionism and his willingness
            to respond to social change in interpreting the halakhah-despite his traditional
            training in a Lithuanian yeshiva. But Weinberg was an unusual man: even at a
            time when he was defending the traditional yeshiva against all attempts at reform,
            he always maintained an interest in the wider world. </p>
          <p>He left Lithuania for Germany at the beginning of the First World War, attended
            the University of Giessen, and increasingly identified with the Berlin school
            of German Orthodoxy. Although initially an apologist for the Nazi regime, he
            was soon recognized as German Orthodoxy's most eminent halakhic authority in
            its efforts to maintain religious tradition in the face of Nazi persecution.
            His approach, then and in his later halakhic writings, including the famous <em>Seridei esh</em>, derived from the conviction that the attempt to shore up
            Orthodoxy by increased religious stringency would only reduce its popular appeal. </p>
          <p>Using a great deal of unpublished material, including private correspondence,
            Marc B. Shapiro discusses many aspects of Weinberg's life. In doing so he elucidates
            many institutional and intellectual phenomena of the Jewish world, a number
            of which have so far received little scholarly attention: the yeshivas of Lithuania;
            the state of the Lithuanian rabbinate; the <em>musar</em> movement; the Jews of
            eastern Europe in Weimar Germany; the Torah im Derekh Eretz movement and its
            variants; Orthodox Jewish attitudes towards Wissenschaft des Judentums; and
            the special problems of Orthodox Jews in Nazi Germany. Throughout, he shows
            the complex nature of Weinberg's character and the inner struggles of a man
            being pulled in different directions. Compellingly and authoritatively written,
            this book performs a great service in illuminating the life of one of twentieth-century
            Judaism's most enigmatic figures.</p>

Yisrael Dubitsky, <strong>AJL Newsletter</strong></p>
          <p><em>'Shapiro's exemplary biography marks the onset of a   new stage in biographical scholarship about leading Orthodox personalities . . .   Shapiro's mastery of rabbinic and historical sources, the fact that no relevant   archival or published source is untouched, the superb contextual studies, the   1,037 enriching and critical footnotes, make this a classic.'</em><br />
            Gershon   Greenberg, <strong>AJS Review</strong><em><br />
</em></p>
          <p><em>Marc Shapiro's excellent new study dedicated to the life and philosophy
            of Rabbi Weinberg is certainly one of the finest pieces of contemporary Jewish
            scholarship . . . This is a monumental study of a great man and a great rabbi.
            It breaks new ground in biographies of &quot;Gedolei Israel&quot; as Rabbi Weinberg is
            depicted as a human being, warts and all. Few events are glossed over-his family,
            philosophy, friends, and career are all discussed in detail without the usual
            embellishments. In addition, this study offers the reader a detailed view of
            the complexities of Orthodox Jewish life in the twentieth century . . . This
            book serves not only as a study of Rabbi Jehiel Weinberg, but as a memorial
            to the vanished world of German Orthodoxy.' <br />
          </em>Zalman Alpert, <strong>Algemeiner Journal</strong></p>
          <p> <em>'With impeccable authority, Marc Shapiro has written an important account . . . an important historical study by a masterful Jewish scholar of a central aspect of Jewish life all too frequently neglected by secular and non-religious Jews . . . No understanding of modern Jewish history can be considered complete without an understanding of how Orthodox Judaism encountered the modern world. Shapiro's study of the life of Jehiel Jacob Weinberg is a major scholarly contribution to our comprehension of that world.'</em><br />
            Richard L. Rubenstein, <strong>American Jewish Congress Monthly</strong></p>
          <p><em>'We are indebted to Marc Shapiro for his brilliant work that brings to life

            David Singer, <strong>First Things</strong></p>
          <p>'<em>A refreshing pleasure . . . Shapiro's scholarly account of Weinberg's remarkable
            life and turbulent times happily avoids the panegyric tone that has too long
            dominated the field of rabbinic &quot;biography&quot;, offering instead a detailed look
            at a rabbi of great learning and character who nonetheless strayed and erred
            about grave matters and who was, by the end of his life, a tragic and lonely
            figure . . . arguably the best biography of twentieth-century rabbi yet written,
            a work of serious scholarship that greatly enriches our understanding of the
            history of European Judaism.</em>' <br />
            Allan Nadler, <strong>Forward</strong></p>

          <p><em>'This first-class, definitive monograph . . . of genuine distinction . .
            . Beautifully executed . . . The dissertation itself deserves nothing but admiration.
            It is well-organized and well-written, intelligent in every aspect, lovingly
            researched but economically set forth . . . Shapiro tells us what we need to
            know and does not over-research or over-sell his subject. Here we have critical
            learning, not hagiography. Unlike equivalent studies of other Orthodox figures,
            however, Shapiro also preserves perspective, balance, proportion, and above
            all coherence, in telling the story. Here we have the definitive account of
            an important subject in the study of the twentieth-century history of Judaism.
            No-one has to go over this subject again. For a first book, that is as high
            praise as I can imagine-or could for a tenth book, for that matter. Shapiro
            takes his place among the most promising and interesting and intelligent scholars
            of his generation.</em>'<br />

      <p>The history of the Jewish communities of these lands-where most of the Jews
        of Europe and America originated-is often the subject of woolly thinking
        and stereotypes. Antony Polonsky recreates this lost world in a way that
        avoids both sentimentalism and the simplification of the east European
        Jewish experience into a story of persecution and martyrdom. This is an
        important story whose relevance extends beyond the Jewish world or the
    bounds of east-central Europe.</p>

        <div class="CollapsiblePanelContent">
          <p>Antony Polonsky provides a comprehensive survey of the history - socio-political,
  economic, and religious - of the Jewish communities of eastern Europe from 1750,
  when the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was the dominant political unit, to
  the present. Until the Second World War, this area was the heartland of the
  Jewish world: almost all the major movements which have characterized that world
  in recent times had their origins here, and it was home to the majority of the
  world's Jews. Nearly three and a half million lived in Poland alone, while nearly
  three million more lived in the Soviet Union. </p>
          <p>Although  the majority of the Jews of Europe and the United States, and most of the Jews  of Israel, originated from these lands, the history of their Jewish communities  is not well known. Rather, it is the subject of mythologizing and stereotypes  that fail both to bring out the specific features of the Jewish civilization  which emerged here and to illustrate what was lost in the passage across the  Channel and the Atlantic. Jewish life in these  parts, though often poor materially, was marked by a high degree of spiritual  and ideological intensity and creativity. Antony Polonsky recreates this lost  world&mdash;brutally cut down by the Holocaust and less brutally but still seriously  damaged by the Soviet attempt to destroy Jewish culture&mdash;in a way that avoids  both sentimentalism and the simplification of the the east European Jewish  experience into a story of persecution and martyrdom. Wherever possible, the  unfolding of history is illustrated by contemporary Jewish writings to show how  Jews felt and reacted to the complex and difficult situations in which they  found themselves.</p>
          <p>It  is an important story whose relevance reaches far beyond the Jewish world or  the bounds of east-central Europe. Polonsky  establishes the context with a review of Jewish life in Poland and Lithuania down to the  mid-eighteenth century, describing the towns and shtetls where the Jews lived,  the institutions they developed, and their participation in the economy. He  also considers their religious and intellectual life, including the emergence  of hasidism, and the growth of opposition to it.</p>
          <p>He  then describes government attempts to integrate and transform the Jews in the  period from 1764 to 1881 and the Jewish response to these efforts. He considers  the impact of modernization and the beginnings of the Haskalah movement, and  looks at developments in each area in turn: the problems of emancipation,  acculturation, and assimilation in Prussian and Austrian Poland; the politics  of integration in the Kingdom   of Poland; and the  failure of forced integration in the tsarist empire.</p>
          <p>The  third part of the book considers the deterioration of the position of the Jews  in the period from 1881 to 1914 and the new Jewish politics that led to the  development of new movements: Zionism, socialism, autonomism, the emergence of  modern Hebrew and Yiddish literature, Jewish urbanization, and the rise of  Jewish mass culture. Galicia,  Prussian Poland, the Kingdom   of Poland, and the  tsarist empire are all treated individually, as are the main towns.</p>
          <p>The final part deals with  the twentieth century. Starting from the First World War and the establishment  of the Soviet Union, it deals in turn with Poland,  Lithuania, and the Soviet Union up to the Second World War. It then reviews  Polish&mdash;Jewish relations during the Second World War and examines the Soviet  record and the Holocaust. The final chapters deal with the Jews in the Soviet  Union and in Poland since  1945, concluding with an epilogue on the Jews in Poland,  Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine,  and Russia  since the collapse of communism. </p>

        <p><em>'Powerful roller coaster narrative'</em><br />
        <strong>15 Minutes Magazine</strong></p>
        <p><em>'Succeeds admirably. Simply put, these volumes are required  reading for anyone with a serious interest in East European history or for  anyone looking for a scholarly assessment of a particular feature of Polish or  Russian Jewish history. Handsomely produced, with extensive maps and tables,  and a glossary . . . will remain a standard work in the field for some time . .  . a body of work that, in summarizing the current state of our knowledge,  effectively sets the agenda for future scholars. Polonsky is perhaps the  scholar most responsible for the growth of Polish Jewish studies in the late  twentieth century . . Very few historians could write a series of volumes like  this . . . [he] has armed scholars with a formidable tool that will help them  dispel stereotypes . . . Just as these volumes are destined to become the  starting point for the work of many students, they will be the touchstone for  scholars working in the field at all levels.'</em> &nbsp; <br />
Sean Martin, <strong>European  History Quarterly</strong></p>
        <p><em>'Combines a masterful grasp of Jewish history  with that of eastern Europe. While underlining the unique features and  achievements of the Jewish communal experience he authoritatively integrates  them into the history of the countries in which Jews lived . . . Incorporating  current, ground-breaking scholarship from North America, Israel, and Europe  these beautifully narrated volumes should not only be seen as a staple of  university courses, but also as a must-read for anyone attempting to understand  any aspect of modern Jewish history and religious tradition, wherever it may be  playing out . . . With this extremely important book, Antony Polonsky not only  writes history but, following the example of his illustrious predecessors,  makes it.'</em><br />
          Katarzyna Person, <strong>European Judaism </strong></p>
        <p><em>'Exemplary and formidable . . . Polonsky, as much as anyone  else, has created the field of modern Jewish history as a subject to be  considered and understood rather than simply a tragic past to be mourned. He is  too good a historian to confuse the history of Jewish life with the German  policies that brought Jewish death . . . The barely visible commitment in these  three wonderful volumes is to rescue a world from polemic, for the sake of  history.' </em><br />
          Timothy Snyder, <strong>Wall Street Journal</strong></p>
        <p><em>'A truly landmark study of east European Jewish history for the mid-fourteenth century to the outbreak of World War I. This work is an invaluable synthetic exposition of Jewish civilization in Poland and Russia that pays close attention to the larger historical context in which Jewish history unfolded in these areas. While exhaustive in presenting historical detail and utilizing available sources and data of all types, Polonsky is also masterful in conveying the texture of Jewish life in different regions during each period. His study weaves together numerous aspects of that life—among others, the relationship of Jewish communities to the states in the region and their governance mechanisms; Jewish religious and political movements; the evolving role of the synagogue in communities; the wide variety of Jewish organizations over time and space; cultural changes, including the development of the mass press, modern literature, and theatre; the experiences of Jewish women; and descriptions of the towns and cities in which Jewish history played out.    The contribution of Polonsky's study, however, is not only an impressive synthesis of a vast topic and vast amount of information. In integrating all of this material, the author also deftly crafts his own interpretations of trends in the area and the timing of shifts in them. His marshalling of evidence and his own insights add up to a compelling set of arguments about the course of Jewish history. Polonsky addresses Jewish, Polish, and Russian historical developments all with great nuance, and that depth of understanding allows him to present the complexities of these intertwined histories with a subtlety rarely achieved in projects of such ambitious temporal and spatial scope. This study will become a &quot;go to&quot; reference for scholars of east European Jewish history for a long time to come.' </em><br />
          From the citation for the 2011 Kulczycki Book Prize for Polish Studies, awarded to Volumes I and II </p>
        <p><em>The second volume of Polonsky's  well-reseached, eloquently written study provides a finely distinct portrait of  Jewish life in eastern Europe in the years leading up to the Great War . . .  Highly recommended.'</em><br />
        R. K. Byczkiewicz, <strong>Choice</strong></p>
<p><em>'The first  two volumes of Antony Polonsky's magisterial The Jews in Poland and Russia  trilogy provide a much-needed addition to the landscape of Jewish historical  studies . . . [a] significant achievement in presenting the most modern  findings in a clear, readable, comprehensive survey . . . his narrative is  grand and his analysis tight . . . an excellent synthesis of this community's  history, incorporating much of the groundbreaking scholarship of the last few decades.  Repeatedly, the volumes remind us of the many lost opportunities for real  reform in the region. They help correct the nostalgic and romanticized  portraits of what is sometimes considered a lost civilization, while  simultaneously demonstrating the vibrancy and diversity of Jewish life in the  region . . . essential reading for those seeking a thorough and balanced  understanding of Jewish life in pre-twentieth century Eastern Europe.' </em><br />
          Jeffrey  Veidlinger, <strong>H-Judaic</strong></p>
<p><em>'For several decades now, Antony Polonsky has been at the forefront of Polish–Jewish studies . . . It is thus fitting that Polonsky, who has nurtured young scholars, especially in Poland itself and North America, should bring together old and new work in this remarkable multi-volume synthesis of Jewish history and culture . . . These volumes will provide the first port of call for any student of east European Jewry.' </em><br />
Tony Kushner,<strong> Jewish Chronicle </strong></p>
<p><em>'We can only commend Antony Polonsky for his massive effort to  explain seven centuries of Jewish history in a mere 2,000 pages . . .  Polonsky's strength lies in his ability to illuminate intellectual and cultural  developments . . . Because of the excellent bibliographies, extensive  annotation, and wonderful maps included in each volume, any reader wishing to  read in greater detail about Polish and Russian Jewry will have plenty of  resources to enable the search.'</em><br />
Alexandra S. Korros, <strong>Jewish  Quarterly</strong></p>
<p><em>'An excellent  synthesis of recent research on east European Jewish culture and history. As  such it fills a definite need for an accessible introduction to the current  scholarship and thinking about the Jews of Poland and Russia . . . should be on  the reading list of anyone interested in the history and folk cultures of  eastern Europe, whether they work specifically with Jewish history and folk culture,  or with other regional cultures.'</em><br />
David Elton Gay, <strong>Journal of Folklore  Research</strong></p>
<p><em>‛Antony Polonsky's three-volume work is without doubt a remarkable achievement in the study of the history of East European Jewry in general, summarizing not only his quarter-century of intellectual labour on this topic but also the work of his predecessors.’</em><br>
  Serhiy Hirik, <strong>Judaica Ukrainica</strong></p>
        <p><em>'Any reader who invests the time  and money to read the book . . . will find it very rewarding—and not just  because of the wealth of information it contains. What Polonsky's book brings  home, in a way that a narrower study could not, is the sheer complexity and vitality  of Jewish life in that time and place . . . this broader picture is needed to  make sense of the social changes that were accelerating by the late nineteenth  century—above all, in the situation of women, the subject of one of Polonsky's  best chapters . . . Polonsky's panoramic book, which packs so much vivid detail  and statistical information into its 500 pages, helps to show just how rich,  and how difficult, that life really was.' &nbsp;</em><br />
          Adam Kirsch, <strong>The New Republic</strong> and <strong>Tablet  Magazine</strong></p>
        <p><em>'Polonsky's magisterial The Jews in Poland and Russia is  one of those rare works that can hope to bridge the gap between specialist and  &quot;intelligent general reader&quot;, providing a strong narrative and appealing prose  for the latter as well as an up-to-date distilled knowledge of both primary and  secondary sources for the former. No one interested in Jewish, Polish, or  Russian history can afford to be without these volumes . . . will long remain  the standard work on this crucial Jewish community . . . While a survey of this  sort requires a goodly bit of politics . . . Polonsky has gone out of his way  to include culture, religious life, gender, Jewish mass culture, and social  history . . . The books' structure is entirely appropriate for its primary  purpose: to provide a basic overview of this Jewish community's history . . .  strikingly high level of scholarship . . . [The publisher] is particularly to  be commended on its allowing Polonsky to cite at length from the Jewish  literary sources he is considering and not begrudging space for a dozen pages  of useful statistics (not a small thing in a publishing world where  bibliographies are often considered superfluous!) . . . This history, written  by a major scholar of both Polish and Jewish history and a person profoundly  attached to both communities, is exemplary in its efforts to integrate Jews  into Polish history, neither white-washing sources of friction nor painting an  overly rosy picture. The most important thing one can say about Antony  Polonsky's The Jews in Poland and Russia is: get it and read it!' </em><br />
Theodore R. Weeks, <strong>The Polish Review</strong></p>
        <p><em>'This superb and very up-to-date book is very well written,  carefully documented, balanced, and will be a standard reference in the field.  It has a glossary and a wide-ranging bibliography, very useful maps, and statistical  tables, all of which make it a good starting point for any reading on east  European Jewry.'</em><br />
        Shaul Stampfer, <strong>Religious Studies Review</strong></p>
        <p><em>‘The first serious, and most successful, effort thus far to summarize the history of the Jews of “Eastern Europe” . . . the first book to synthesize the vast research that has emerged since the seventies . . . comprehensive and multidisciplinary . . . there is no book today that can compare to its scope and to the vast and new materials that he brings forth and analyzes with a broad imagination, an intensive approach, and a moderate style.’</em><br />

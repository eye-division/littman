          <p>The medieval Crown of Aragon reached the peak of its power and influence in
            the thirteenth century, and Jews took an active part in this expansion. In this
            detailed and meticulously researched study Yom Tov Assis deals with many important
            aspects of this period, which was truly a 'Golden Age' in the history of Aragonese
            and Catalan Jewry, both in terms of their relationship with the Crown and of
            their own cultural achievements. </p>
          <p>Professor Assis provides the most extensive treatment yet of Jewish self-government
            in the Hispanic kingdoms and the mutual interdependence of the Jewish and Christian
            communities. He describes institutions in very great detail, and examines the
            acute social problems that arose in the Jewish community and the dissent, polemics,
            and controversies that divided it. He shows how the proximity of the country
            to France and Provence on the one hand, and to Castile and Andalusia on the
            other, made Catalan Jewry a point of contact between Ashkenazi and Sephardi
            Jewry, demonstrating the effect this had on religious and cultural life, and
            in particular the consequences of the growing influence in Spain of Franco-German
            Jewry. </p>
          <p>The book is based on a very wide variety of primary sources-Jewish and non-Jewish,
            archival and halakhic material, notarial and royal records-in Latin, Catalan,
            Aragonese, and Hebrew. By drawing on these extensive sources, the author has
            been able to create a comprehensive description of the social, religious, and
            administrative aspects of Jewish life that throws much light on the wider society
            and economy of that period under the Crown of Aragon. The abundant detailed
            source notes make this an indispensable work of reference for all scholars of
            medieval Spanish history.</p>

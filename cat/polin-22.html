  <p>Boundaries - physical, political, social,  religious, and cultural - were a key feature of life in medieval and early modern  Poland.

      <p>Boundaries&mdash;physical, political, social, religious, and  cultural&mdash;were a key feature of life in medieval and early modern Poland, and  this volume focuses on the ways in which these boundaries were respected,  crossed, or otherwise negotiated. It throws new light on the contacts between  Jews and Poles, including the vexed question of conversion and the tensions it  aroused. The collected articles also discuss relations between the various  elements of Jewish society&mdash;the wealthy and the poor, the educated and the uneducated,  and the religious and the lay elites, considering too contacts between Jews in  Poland and those in Germany and elsewhere. Classic studies by such eminent  scholars as Meir Ba&#322;aban, Jacob Goldberg, and Moshe Rosman provide a foil for  new research by Hanna Zaremska and David Frick, as well as Adam Teller, Magda  Teter, Elisheva Carlebach, J&uuml;rgen Heyde, and Adam Ka&#378;mierczyk. Taken together,  the contributions on this central theme help redefine the Jewish history of  pre-modern Poland.</p>
      <p>As ever, the New Views section examines a wide variety of other  topics. These include accusations of ritual murder in nineteenth-century  Poland; the Russian Jewish integrationist politician Mikhail Morgulis; the  attitude of Boles&#322;aw Prus towards Jewish assimilation and his relationship with  the Jewish journalist Nahum Sokolow; women in the Mizrahi movement in Poland;  Polish patriotism among Jews; the impact of the first Soviet occupation of  1939&ndash;41 on Polish&ndash;Jewish relations; how the war affected the views of Julian Tuwim  and Antoni S&#322;onimski; the shtetl in the work of American Jewish writers Allen  Hoffman and Jonathan Safran Foer; and the initial Polish response to Jan  Gross's <em>Fear</em>.</p>

          <p><em>'This is a notable contribution  to the leading English-language series on Polish Jewry. It can serve as an  ideal starting point for students interested in the development of Judaism in  Eastern Europe in pre-modern Poland. The introduction by Teller and Teter  offers an incisive picture of much of the historiography of of the period,  while many of the articles offer both background and detailed pictures of  specific institutions and events that are important for religious studies . . .  Libraries with a serious collection dealing with Eastern European Jewish life  and culture might want to consider the series in its entirety.</em>' Shaul Stampfer, <strong>Religious Studies Review</strong></p>

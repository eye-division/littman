Leon Sheleff, <strong>Jerusalem Post</strong></p>
          <p>The two volumes of this work comprise the first comprehensive history of the
            kibbutz movement in any language.</p>
          <p><em>Origins and Growth</em> covers the first thirty years of this fascinating
            story, from the formation of the kibbutz in the opening years of the twentieth
            century to the eve of the Second World War. It is a masterly analysis of the
            genesis and expansion of the kibbutzim and their relations with the world around
            them. It considers not only the various components of the kibbutz movement but
            also the pioneering youth movements from which their members came.</p>
          <p>Henry Near&#8217;s analysis of the ideological, political, economic, and social
            development of the kibbutz movement is illustrated throughout by excerpts from
            historical sources, affording a wealth of colourful insights into the changing
            quality of kibbutz life as experienced by its members.</p>
          <p>The second volume, <em><a href="near-2.html">Crisis and Achievement, 1939-1995</a></em> extends the detailed
            historical analysis to 1977 and gives a comprehensive overview of subsequent
            developments.</p>

    <p> <em>'Those

    <br />
        Ephraim Tabory, <strong>Contemporary Jewry</strong></p>
      <p>How do the Jews of post-Holocaust, post-communist Europe—east  and west—regard themselves: as a religious minority, an ethnic group, or simply  as ordinary members of the communities in which they live? How do they regard  non-Jews and relate to the Jews of other European countries? Is Israel a factor  in forging these relationships? In confronting these questions, the  contributors to this book—all of them writers with significant international reputations—cover  a wide range of topics from different perspectives. Authoritative and  accessible, the book is essential reading for anyone who wishes to know about  the contemporary concerns of the Jews of Europe.</p>

          <p>How do the Jews of post-Holocaust, post-communist  Europe—east and west—regard themselves? Do they perceive themselves as a  religious minority, an ethnic group, or simply as ordinary members of the wider  European cultures in which they live? How do they regard the wider non-Jewish  community, and how do they relate to the Jews of other European countries? To  what extent is Israel a factor in forging these relationships?</p>
          <p>            The contributors to this book are authorities in their  respective subjects, and all have significant international reputations.  Together they cover a wide range of topics from different perspectives. Among  the problems considered are: what the future holds for the Jews of Europe; what  it means to be Jewish in the countries of eastern Europe (Russia, Poland, and  Hungary are considered in detail by local experts); hopes and uncertainties in  religious trends; and the likely development of interfaith relations, as seen  by both Jews and Christians. A well-argued introduction identifies the points  of convergence, the contradictions, and the myths implicit in the different  analyses and teases out the main conclusions and implications.</p>
          <p>            Authoritative and accessible, this book is essential  reading for anyone who wishes to know about the contemporary concerns of the  Jews of Europe.<br />

          <p>'<em>Webber's introductory essay and his chapter on Jewish identity are particularly
  effective in highlighting the impact of a European environment on its Jews.
  Indeed, the reader encounters comparisons throughout the book that span countries
  and history, or is led to such comparisons by the different foci of the various
  articles. . . . Webber's volume has the potential to stimulate further empirical
  research in Europe, as well as shedding light on the situation there for non-Europeans
  who tend to overlook that continent. Those who care about the future of the
  Jews and Judaism, whether it be in Europe or elsewhere, will find this a very
  welcome addition to the literature.</em>'<br />
Ephraim Tabory, <strong>Contemporary Jewry </strong></p>
          <p>'<em>A rich book, containing many interesting insights and observations . .
            . excellent introductory survey by Jonathan Webber</em>.'<br />
            Andr&eacute; W. M. Gerrits, <strong>Ethnic &amp; Racial Studie</strong>s </p>
          <p>'<em>The twenty-four contributors to this excellent collection of essays are
            distinguished academic and spiritual leaders of present-day Jewry, mainly in
            Europe, who have devoted much thought to the problems confronting our people
            in the modern Western world. . . . The topics covered are varied and important.</em>' <br />
            Miriam Kraus, <strong>Jerusalem Post</strong></p>
          <p> '<em>Timely . . . an impressive assortment of views, wide-ranging in their
            scope, analysing demographic, sociological and religious trends, surveying particular
            communities in Eastern and Western Europe, looking at inter-faith relations,
            and the role of Israel and the Holocaust in defining contemporary Jewish identity
            . . . interesting, informative and challenging.</em>' <br />
            Valerie Monchi, <strong>Jewish Chronicle</strong></p>
          <p> '<em>Some of the essays in this volume seem already to have been overtaken
            by events, while other remain strikingly prescient. Taken as a whole, however,
            this book is a useful contribution to the contemporary debate over the nature
            of the new Europe, while offering valuable insights for the study of modern
            Jewish history.'</em><br />
            John D. Klier, <strong>Journal of European Studies</strong></p>
          <p> '<em>The strength of the compilation lies in the wide variety of viewpoints
            that originate not simply from Europe but also from Israel and the United States
            . . . the breadth of coverage in the 290 pages is remarkable . . . Readers interested
            in a particular approach or topic should scan the contents carefully and use
            them in conjunction with the concise biographical notes to pinpoint articles
            to meet their needs. They will be helped in this by Jonathan Webber's comprehensive
            analytical introductory essay which also points straightforwardly to what is
            missing from the discussion</em>.' <br />

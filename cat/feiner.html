            Edward Breuer, <strong>Jewish Quarterly Review </strong></p>
          <p>Shmuel Feiner's innovative book recreates the historical consciousness that
            fired the Haskalah-the Jewish Enlightenment movement. The proponents of this
            movement advocated that Jews should capture the spirit of the future and take
            their place in wider society, but as Jews-without denying their collective identity
            and without denying their past. Claiming historical legitimacy for their ideology
            and their vision of the future, they formulated an ethos of modernity that they
            projected on to the universal and the Jewish past alike. </p>
          <p>What was the image of the past that the maskilim shaped? What tactics underpinned
            their use of history? How did their historical awareness change and develop-from
            the inception of the Haskalah in Germany at the time of Mendelssohn and Wessely,
            through the centres of Haskalah in Austria, Galicia, and Russia, to the emergence
            of modern nationalism in the maskilic circles in eastern Europe in the last
            third of the nineteenth century? These are some of the questions raised in this
            fascinating exploration of an ideological approach to history which throws a
            searching new light on the Jewish Enlightenment movement and the emergence of
            Jewish historical consciousness more generally. </p>
          <p><em>From reviews of the Hebrew edition</em></p>
          <p>'<em>This excellent and learned book makes an important contribution to the

His mastery of the relevant sources and the scholarly literature on Enlightenment is phenomenal, as is the quality and quantity of his meticulous studies of key Haskalah phenomena and figures . . . a deeply rewarding book. Its very expansiveness suits its author's ambition to understand the Haskalah in its entirety, a task to which Feiner, as much as anyone, is equal . . . a work the reader can luxuriate in . . . this study, in its highly readable translation, now provides the best single-volume treatment in English of the broad (and yes, revolutionary) ideology of the Haskalah.' </em><br />

<p>Sharon Flatto's  comprehensive study offers  the first systematic overview of the eighteenth-century Jewish community of  Prague and the first critical account of the life and thought of its  pre-eminent rabbinic authority, Ezekiel Landau. Her detailed analysis, firmly  rooted in the historical and cultural context of the period, challenges the  conventional portrayal of Landau as a staunch opponent of esoteric practices  and reveals the centrality of kabbalistic thought in this key central European  city.      </p>

          <p>Kabbalah, an  esoteric lore whose study was traditionally restricted, played a surprisingly  prominent and far-reaching role in eighteenth-century Prague. In this book  Sharon Flatto uncovers the centrality of this mystical tradition for Prague&rsquo;s  influential Jewish community and its pre-eminent rabbinic authority, Ezekiel  Landau, chief rabbi from 1754 to 1793.</p>
          <p>A towering  eighteenth-century rabbinic leader who is best known for his halakhic responsa  collection the <em>Noda biyehudah</em>, Landau is generally considered a staunch  opponent of esoteric practices and public kabbalistic discourse. Flatto  challenges this portrayal, exposing the importance of kabbalah in his work and  thought and demonstrating his novel use of teachings from diverse kabbalistic  schools. She also identifies the historical events and cultural forces  underlying his reluctance to discuss kabbalah publicly, including the rise of  the hasidic movement and the acculturation spurred by the 1781 Habsburg  Toleranzpatent.</p>
          <p>In telling this  story, the study offers the first systematic overview of the eighteenth-century  Jewish community of Prague, and the first critical account of Landau&rsquo;s life and  writings, which continue to shape Jewish law and rabbinic thought to this day. Extensively  examining Landau's rabbinic corpus, as well as a variety of archival and  published German, Yiddish, and Hebrew sources, it provides a unique glimpse  into the spiritual and psychological world of eighteenth-century Prague Jewry.</p>
          <p>Reconstructing  the intellectual world and traditional society in which Landau lived, this  study reveals the dominance of rabbinic culture in Prague during this  transitional period, the ongoing significance of kabbalistic ideas and  practices, and the city&rsquo;s numerous distinguished figures and institutions. Its  analysis of the spiritual trends that animated this culture demonstrates that  Prague&rsquo;s late eighteenth-century rabbinate was more influential, more  conservative, and less open to modernization than has been recognized.  Debunking the widespread scholarly portrayal of Prague as primarily under the  influence of the modernizing West, Flatto shows that this key central European  city was shaped more by traditional east European Jewish culture than by  Western Enlightenment thought.</p>
          <p>By  unravelling and exploring the many diverse threads that were woven into the  fabric of Prague's eighteenth-century Jewish life, the book offers a comprehensive  portrayal of rabbinic culture at its height in one of the largest and most  important centres of European Jewry.</p>

          <p><em>'Remarkable intellectual  biography . . . a major contribution to the understanding of the diffusion and  the role of Kabbalah in Europe in the eighteenth century. The book renews our  knowledge of the cultural history of Ashkenazi society and, especially, of the  Jewish community of Prague during the premodern period . . . An innovative  aspect of Flatto's book is the study of Landau's relationship to mysticism,  which was not without some ambivalence . . . an important contribution to the  study of the cultural history of Jewish communities in Europe in the eighteenth  century. [The book] leads us to reconsider the transformation of Jewish  culture, viewed as a complex whole made up of a plurality of influences, of  cultural and religious components, and full of contradictions and tensions.  This remarkable research demonstrates that the transformation of Jewish society  was far from linear.' &nbsp; </em><br />
          Jean Baumgarten, <strong>H-Judaic</strong></p>
          <p><em>‛Constructs a map of Landau’s views on kabbalistic matters…that changes how we look at eighteenth-century Judaism…Flatto’s book is crucial for any attempt to understand eighteenth-century Jews.’</em><br />
          Joseph Davis, <strong>Jewish History</strong></p>
          <p><em>'A very good book. The scholarship is first rate, with every claim backed up by evidence. The presentation is also excellent, being well organized, clear and above all interesting . . . the author is to be congratulated and the book firmly recommended.'   </em><br />
          A.H. Lesser, <strong>Journal of Modern Jewish Studies</strong></p>
          <p><em>‛Offers a fascinating picture of Jewish culture in eighteenth-century Prague . . . based on rigorous analyses of texts and a wide-ranging collection of sources. This volume gives the English reader a fine introduction to central European rabbinic culture and sheds new light on hasidism and on modernization in Jewish religion. It does so in a very readable and clear manner.’</em><br />
          Shaul Stampfer, <strong>Religious Studies Review</strong></p>
<p><em>'Challenges the conventional portrait of  Landau as a staunch opponent of esoteric practices and reveals the centrality  of kabbalistic thought in this key central European city.'</em><br />

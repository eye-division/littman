    <p>Moshe Rosman </p>
<p><strong>Joint  winner of the 2010 Jordan Schnitzer Book Award</strong> for&nbsp;Early Modern and  Modern Jewish History</p>
<p>Moshe Rosman presents a cogent and critical argument for the  considerations that must be brought to bear on the writing of Jewish history  today. By highlighting in one book the issues raised by postmodernism, <em>How Jewish is Jewish History?</em> considers  the questions that Jewish historians must confront if their work is to be taken  seriously by mainstream intellectuals, or indeed by educated Jews interested in  understanding their own cultural and historical past.</p>

    <p><strong>Joint  winner of the 2010 Jordan Schnitzer Book Award</strong> for&nbsp;Early Modern and  Modern Jewish History</p>
    <p>With great vigour and from the vantage point of long experience of  writing and teaching Jewish history, Moshe Rosman treats the key questions that  postmodernism raises for the writing of Jewish history. What is the  relationship between Jewish culture and history and those of the non-Jews among  whom Jews live? Can we&mdash;in the light of postmodernist thought&mdash;speak of a  continuous, coherent Jewish People, with a distinct culture and history? What in  fact is Jewish cultural history, and how can it be written? How does gender  transform the Jewish historical narrative? How does Jewish history fit into the  multicultural paradigm? Has Jewish history entered a postmodern phase? How can  Jewish history utilize the methodologies of other disciplines to accomplish its  task? All these are questions that Jewish historians need to think about if  their work is to be taken seriously by mainstream historians and intellectuals,  or indeed by educated Jews interested in understanding their own cultural and  historical past.<br />
      &nbsp;<br />
      While engaging with the questions raised by postmodernists, the  author adopts a critical stance towards their work. His basic claim is that it  is possible to incorporate, judiciously, postmodern innovations into historical  scholarship that is still based on documentary research and critical analysis.  The resulting endeavor might be termed &lsquo;a reformed positivism&rsquo;. <br />
      &nbsp;<br />
      Rosman presents a concentrated, coherent, cogent argument as to  what considerations must be brought to bear on the writing of Jewish history  today. By highlighting in one book the issues raised by postmodernism, <em>How Jewish is Jewish History?</em> provides  those in the field with a foundation from which to discuss how it should be  practiced in light of this generation&rsquo;s challenges. It is a valuable resource  for students of Jewish history and historiography and a handy tool for scholars  who must confront the issues aired here in their own more narrowly focused  scholarly works.</p>
    <p>&lsquo;<em>Moshe Rosman is an innovative and independent-minded historian  whose work is always fascinating, thoughtful, and well-argued. The subject of  his most recent book is one that is much agitating the world of academic Jewish  scholarship. I cannot think of a recently published book that I have been more  eager to read.</em>&rsquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
      Todd Endelman,<strong> University   of Michigan</strong></p>
    <p>&lsquo;<em>Moshe Rosman is one  of the few Jewish historians who can deal with the theoretical issues besetting  Jewish historiography, particularly in the light of post-modernist thought.  This book sets an agenda that will be discussed for many years hence.</em>&rsquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />

          <p>'<em>Moshe Rosman&rsquo;s&nbsp;How Jewish Is Jewish  History&nbsp;is a lucid, engaged, but also dispassionate work certain to  become a crucial point of departure for future discussions of  fundamental&nbsp;questions facing Jewish studies. It asks, and sets out to  offer some answers to the question as to whether historians can maintain the  continuity and distinctiveness of the Jewish experience. Rosman sees Jewish  historiography as having been altered at its core by postmodernism, and offers  an incisive and original &ldquo;polythetic approach&rdquo; to this dilemma grounded in a  &ldquo;reformed&rdquo; positivism. &nbsp;This is a wise, courageous, challenging book,  subtle, made of many different parts, all of which are insightful, and likely  to be of enduring significance</em>'<em><br />
          </em>from the citation for the <strong>2010  Jordan Schnitzer Book Award</strong></p>
<p><em>'While addressing the issues raised by postmodernism,  Rosman provides a starting point from which to discuss how this generation  might tackle these challenges. For students of Jewish history and  historiography, this is a most worthwhile read . . . Recommended.'&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;<br />
            S. D. Benin, <strong>Choice</strong></p>
          <p><em>'Provides clear and insightful expositions of some  central contemporary theoretical and methodological issues as they relate to  some crucial themes in Jewish history in particular. It provides a learned and  highly articulate defence of a pragmatic, moderate, and 'centrist' position by  one of the influential practitioners of Jewish history writing . . . a highly  valuable attempt to confront some of the major challenges posed by recent  innovations from a firm position and in a coherent way. What is more, this  collection has much to contribute to the definition of a badly needed common  ground between supporters and opponents of postmodernism and thereby helps to  diffuse much of the unpleasant polemic that has often surrounded the emergence  of postmodern critiques.' </em><br />
          Ferenc Laczó, <strong>European Journal of Jewish Studies</strong></p>
<p><em>'His brief, incisive, and welcome conversation with contemporary  Jewish historiography will be of inordinate use to the perplexed of our time.' </em>&nbsp;  Steven Bowman, <strong>H-Judaic</strong></p>
          <p><em>'Both thought-provoking and entertaining . . . thoroughly  engaging and makes one ponder deeply on the basic issues of Jewish  historiography. It should be read by all Jewish historians whether they are  contemplating writing a grand narrative or a micro-study.'&nbsp;</em>&nbsp; <br />
            John Cooper, <strong>Jewish Historical Studies</strong></p>
          <p><em>'He presents a comprehensive work in English on the  problems and challenges of writing Jewish history under the impact of  postmodern ideas and multiculturalism, forwhich he deserves credit . . . The  book's strong points include its extensive bibliography and excellent  documentation.' </em><br />
          Rivkah Duker Fishman, <strong>Jewish Political Studies Review</strong></p>
          <p><em>'Excellent . . . it is a most important and essential book for anyone interested in Jewish affairs. It is an overview of how academic theories of modernism are changing and have changed perceptions. It is a vital analysis of how many different approaches to Jewish history there are . . . Rosman raises all the fascinating issues.' </em><br />
Jeremy Rosen, <strong>The Jewish Press</strong></p>
<p><em>'Cogently written, remarkably combining depth of analysis with clear, straightforward writing . . . Rosman has confronted the sharpest challenges for Jewish historiography laid down by contemporary modes of thinking.'</em><br />
            Michael A. Meyer, <strong>Jewish Quarterly Review</strong></p>
          <p><em>&lsquo;Rosman&nbsp;reviews the newest developments in Jewish  historiography in the context of the historical theoretical debates of  postmodern and postcolonial studies. In particular, he focuses on the  definition of &ldquo;self&rdquo; and &ldquo;other&rdquo; in Jewish culture and history and on the  relationship between them.&rsquo; </em>&nbsp;<br />
            Ekaterina Emeliantseva, <strong>Osteuropa</strong></p>
          <p><em>'Absolutely essential reading for any student thinking of writing  a thesis or even a serious paper on Jewish history. It is a profound analysis  of what the academic study of Jewish history is and what should be taken into  consideration in setting out to do research in the field. Rosman asks  penetrating questions regarding the possibility of objective study of Jewish  history in the light of the issues raised by postmodernist thinking and he  sensitively explores ways of dealing with these questions. He applies his wide  and perceptive reading in general historiography to clarify the challenge of  new modes of historical thought to students of Jewish history. His mastery of  the Jewish past, especially but not only of Jewish life in eastern Europe,  keeps the discussion from being purely theoretical . . . While Rosman deals  with complex issues, his writing is lucid and his examples are fascinating.  There is nothing like this book on the market and it is therefore a crucial  introduction for students. While Rosman's examples are drawn from the context  of Jewish history, the issues he raises apply to the historiography of other  religious and cultural groups. Therefore, while this brilliant book should be  required reading for all serious students of Jewish studies, it should be  equally interesting to students of other traditions.' &nbsp; </em><br />
            Shaul Stampfer, <strong>Religious  Studies Review</strong></p>
          <p><em>'Rosman's erudite volume ranges over more theoretical ground than  can be explained in a brief review . . . a useful introduction to the heat that  history and historiographical disputes generate in contemporary Israel.'<br />
          </em>Michael C. Hickey, <strong>Shofar</strong></p>
          <p><em>'Incisive.' </em><br />
          Nils Roemer, <strong>Studies in  Contemporary Jewry</strong></p>
          <p><em>'Rosman helps us understand how history has become, in the hands of postmodern awareness, more complicated, less unitary, and still deeply fascinating . . . an important entry in an important debate over the understanding of our multiple pasts in the complex present.' </em><br />

    <p>This
        study examines the modern revival of the belief among religious Jews that
        they are duty-bound to hasten messianic redemption. It focuses on the
        efforts of Rabbi Tsevi Hirsch Kalischer, who presented a unique interpretation
        of classical Jewish texts in support of reviving sacrificial worship and
        Jewish agricultural settlement in Palestine. Kalischer&#8217;s achievements
        are placed in the context of the Enlightenment, Jewish civic emancipation,
        European colonialism, and the emerging religious divisions between Jews.</p>

          <p>Tsevi Hirsch Kalischer (1795-1874) was one of
            the first Orthodox rabbis to advocate direct political action in order to radically
            transform Jewish life. Kalischer lived in a time when Jewish tradition was increasingly
            challenged by rational thought and social integration. Applying his knowledge
            of rabbinic literature to the unusual historical events unfolding around him,
            he became convinced that behind the rise of individual Jews to great power was
            a divine plan to prepare the way for messianic redemption. Kalischer anticipated
            that in his own lifetime he would see the ingathering of the Jews, the renewed
            cultivation of the land of Israel, and the restoration of sacrificial worship.
            This would be achieved not through supernatural agency but by the efforts of
            the Jews themselves, in the spirit of the time. The Jewish people was obligated
          by God to &#8216;seek Zion&#8217;.</p>
          <p>Kalischer began his quest as early as 1836 when he approached the banker Amschel
            Mayer Rothschild with a plan to acquire Jerusalem and revive sacrificial worship.
            However, lacking Rothschild's co-operation and the approval of his rabbinic
            colleagues, Kalischer set aside his dream for almost twenty years. In 1862,
            spurred to action by the granting of equal rights to Jews and European assistance
            to the Jews of Palestine, he published his theories in Derishat tsiyon (Seeking
            Zion). From then until his death, Kalischer promoted and raised funds on behalf
            of the establishment of agricultural communes in Palestine.</p>
          <p>In this book Jody Myers explores for the first time the full range of Kalischer's
            writings&#8212;philosophical essays, correspondence, halakhic research, and
            biblical exegesis&#8212;presenting and critically analysing his groundbreaking
            formulation of modern messianic activism, which paved the way for later religious
            Zionism. She shows how Kalischer's approach marks a pivotal transition in the
            history of the messianic idea, and explains how he designed his arguments to
            appeal both to religious Jews and to the newly emancipated Jews of western Europe
            who, grateful for their own fortune, wanted to assist the impoverished Jews
            of the Middle East. At the same time, his proposals generated controversy and
            uncovered the growing schisms between Jews in modern times. Through Kalischer's
            eyes, the reader gains a fascinating perspective on what it means to be both
            religious and modern.</p>

            J. Haus, <strong>Choice</strong></p>
          <p> This history of the Jews of the Netherlands and the role they have played
            in Dutch society was originally published in Dutch and widely acclaimed for
            the breadth of its coverage. It covers both the internal evolution of the Jewish
            community and its social, cultural, and economic interaction with the wider
            population. </p>
          <p>From the first Jewish settlements in the medieval duchies of Gelderland, Brabant,
            and Limburg to the Jewish community of today, the interaction between Dutch
            Jews and Dutch Christians has generally been one of fruitful collaboration which
            only the period of German occupation from 1940 to 1944 was seriously able to
            disrupt. The contribution that Dutch Jews have made, and continue to make, to
            cultural life, to the economy, and to science is recognized as being of central
            importance to the Netherlands as a whole.</p>
          <p>The ten eminent scholars contributing to this book each describe Jewish life
            in a particular period, from the Middle Ages to the present. In doing so they
            consider the strains caused within the Jewish community by the effort to play
            a full part in Dutch society, while maintaining Jewish culture, setting the
            discussion in the context of trends and tensions within Dutch society in the
            period in question. The circumstances of the Jews under German occupation and
            in the immediate post-war period are also discussed.</p>
          <p><em>The History of the Jews in the Netherlands</em> is a definitive, indispensable
            work for the study of both Jewish and Dutch history.</p>
          <p>From reviews of the Dutch edition:<br />
            <em>'Presents a clear picture of the longer-term developments without any sacrifice
              of &quot;living history&quot;. Much space is devoted to social and religious life, to
              culture and to the economy . . . Particularly impressive . . . does honour to
            its status as a general survey.'</em> <br />
            Frank van Vrees, <strong>De Volkskrant</strong></p>
          <p> <em>'Thanks to its wealth of anecdotes and readable style, this general survey
            should appeal to a wide public interested in the history of the Jews in the

        Europe</span><br />
        <span class="author">Shaul Stampfer</span>      </p>
  <p>The family and the community, which were in a very real sense the core  institutions of east European Jewish society, underwent very rapid change in  the nineteenth century. These essays look at the past through the prism of the  lives of ordinary people, with results that are sometimes surprising, but  always stimulating. The topics they treat are varied, but the concern to  explain what lay behind the visible reality is common to all of them.</p>

      <p>The realities of Jewish life in eastern  Europe that concerned the average Jew meant the way their children grew up, the  way they studied, how they married, and all the subsequent stages of the life  cycle--including the problems of divorce, remarriage, and elderly parents. The  family and the community were in a very real sense the core institutions of  east European Jewish society. These realities were always dynamic and evolving  but in the nineteenth century, the pace of change in almost every area of life  was exceptionally rapid. <br />
  &nbsp;<br />
        This collection of essays deals with these social realities  objectively and analytically. Some of the essays presented here are classics  that have been widely acclaimed, earning their author a well-deserved  reputation for authoritative research; all have been comprehensively revised  for this book. They avoid both sentimental descriptions and judgmental  attitudes. The result is a picture that is far from the stereotyped view of the  past that is common today, but a more honest and more comprehensive one. <br />
  &nbsp;<br />
        Topics covered in the studies on education consider the learning  experiences of both males and females of different ages. They also deal with  and distinguish between study among the well off and learned (not surprisingly,  the two went together) and study among the poorer masses. A number of essays  are devoted to aspects of educating the elite. Here too, the reconstruction of  the realities of the past, as opposed to the stereotypical popular image,  reveals the remarkable creativity of what is often mistakenly considered a  highly conservative element of society. </p>
      <p>Several essays deal with aspects of marriage, a key element in the  life of most Jews. Using both quantitative and qualitative sources, the author  has been able to identify and document characteristics of both first and  subsequent marriages and to highlight and explain trends that have hitherto  been misunderstood. The problem of aged parents and the changing nature of the  nuclear family is also considered.</p>
      <p>The attempt to understand the rabbinate in its social and  historical context is no less revealing then the studies in other areas. The  realities of rabbinical life &circ; the problems of getting appointments, job  security and insecurity, changing responsibilities and the difficulties of  dealing with fragmented and modernizing communities -- are presented in a way  that explains rabbinic behavior and the complex relations between communities,  ideologies, and modernization.</p>
      <p>These essays look at  the past through the prism of the lives of ordinary people, with results that  are sometimes surprising but always stimulating. The topics they treat are  varied, but the concern to explain what lay behind the visible reality is  common to all of them.</p>

          <p><em>'Represents decades of  intensive study of Jewish daily life in eastern Europe. The book brings  together many of Stampfer's previously published writings, although several  appear here in English for the first time . . . provides us with the oeuvre of  a scholar who has spent years thinking about these issues and provides a  wonderful context for further study.'</em><br />
          Jeffrey Veidlinger, <strong>East  European Jewish Affairs</strong> </p>
          <p><em>‘Stampfer draws on a huge range of sources . . . to throw light on his central concern: the Jews of eastern Europe in the period of modernization . . . Almost every chapter teaches us anew about something we thought we already knew . . . discoveries that contradict received wisdom abound. His specialty is in considering topics that seem marginal but in fact prove vital in understanding key elements of Jewish life . . . focusing on the social function of each institution rather than idealistic interpretations . . . A sub-theme central to his work is the role and status of women . . . these studies present a picture that contradicts the romantic image of the shtetl Jew that is still so beloved of the general public, and even to some extent among academics . . . While correcting these distortions, Stampfer emphasizes the functionality of Jewish institutions in the changing realities of the time, while also demonstrating the differences between Jews and their neighbours as regards marriage, family life, housing, economics, education and culture. He shows how the traditional Jewish institutions developed and adapted to the challenges of modernity and helped Jews to prosper in a way that was unique to them.’</em><br />
          Moshe Rosman, <strong>Gal-Ed</strong></p>
          <p><em>'For many years, Shaul Stampfer has been recognised as an  authority in all things dealing with nineteenth-century Jewish Eastern Europe.  In his newest book, we have a collection of numerous essays representing more  than twenty years of his scholarship, including one essay published for the  first time. Stampfer's focus is not on the purely intellectual debates between  rabbinic elites. He is more interested in social history, how average people  and in particular women lived. Even his discussions of rabbis emphasize such  matters as inheritance of rabbinic positions and the rabbi's role in communal  life. His sources are quite broad: traditional rabbinic works as well as  Hebrew, Yiddish, and Russian texts and newspapers . . .there is much more that  can be said about Stampfer's careful scholarship, which is a treat for all  readers.' &nbsp;</em> <br />
Marc B. Shapiro, <strong>H-Judaic</strong></p>
          <p><em>'Accessible and lively . . . a good read  not only for scholars, but also for general readers interested in seeing just  how far we have come from that vanished world.'</em><br />
          <strong>Jewish Book  World</strong> </p>
          <p><em>'This book of essays by an exceptionally wide-ranging social and  cultural historian is much more than a rich investigation of &quot;traditional  society&quot;.'</em><br />
          Kenneth B. Moss, <strong>Journal of Modern History</strong></p>
          <p><em>'This riveting collection of essays  covers a breathtaking scope, the amount of research is impressive, and the  level of analysis is as refreshing as it is innovative. It is hard to name any  other work that covers such a diverse range of fascinating questions in Jewish  history in such a learned and professional manner. The author has an uncanny  ability to synthesize a diverse range of material with interpretations and  analyses that are as brilliant as they are straightforward. This collection  will make an excellent companion to extant English and Hebrew language works on  modern Jewish history. It will also make for interesting reading in  undergraduate classes and graduate seminars on social history, east European  history, and Jewish history. In short, this is a gem of a book, the kind that  you will want to read, the kind that students will love to read, the kind that  scholars as well will not be able to put down.'</em><br />
          Scott Ury, <strong>Religious  Studies Review</strong>        </p>
<p><em>‘Eruditely documented, clearly explained, subtly argued, these contributions on the evolution of educational and family structures and on the history of the rabbinate renew our knowledge of Jewish society in eastern Europe. Anyone who seeks to understand the transformations peculiar to this period can only consult and explore this work of reference.’</em><br />

      <p>American Reform Judaism's major institutions-Hebrew Union College, the
        Central Conference of American Rabbis, and the Reform prayer-book <em>Minhag
        America</em> - were all due to the singular efforts of Isaac Mayer Wise
        (1819-1900). Professor Temkin's biography captures the vigour of Wise's
        personality and the politics and concerns of Jewish life and leadership
        in America at that time. It is a lively portrait of a rabbi who was a
        pivotal figure in the naturalization of Jews and Judaism in the New World</p>

          <p>Isaac Mayer Wise (1819&#8211;1900), founder of the major institutions of Reform
            Judaism in America, was a man of his time&#8212;a pioneer in a pioneer&#8217;s
            world. When he came to America from his childhood Bohemia in 1846, he found
            fewer than 50,000 Jews and only two ordained rabbis. With his sense of mission
            and tireless energy, he set himself to tailoring the vehicle of Reform Judaism
            to meet the needs of the growing Jewish community.</p>
          <p>Wise strove for unity among American Jews, and for a college to train rabbis
            to serve them. The establishment of Hebrew Union College (1875) was the crowning
            achievement of his life. His quest for unity also led him to draw up an American
            Jewish prayer-book, <em>Minhag America</em>, to found the Central Conference
            of American Rabbis, and to edit two weeklies; their editorials, breathing fire
            and energy, were no less important in his quest for leadership. Here as elsewhere,
            it was his persistence that won him the war where his impetuosity lost him many
            battles.</p>
          <p>Professor Temkin&#8217;s writing captures the vigour of Wise&#8217;s personality
            and the politics and concerns of contemporary Jewish life and leadership in
            America. Based primarily on material in the American Jewish Archives of the
            Hebrew Union College, this biography is a lively portrait of a rabbi whose singular
            efforts in many fields made him a pivotal figure in the naturalization of the
            Jew and Judaism in the New World.</p>
          <p>The book was first published in hardback in 1992 under the title<em> Isaac
            Mayer Wise: Shaping American Judaism</em>.</p>

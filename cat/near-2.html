          <p>This volume continues the narrative account of the history of the kibbutz movement
            from the outbreak of the Second World War onwards. This period included a number
            of dramatic and complex developments: the effects of the world war and the Holocaust
            on the kibbutzim and their youth movements; the political struggles which led
            to the end of the British mandate; the War of Independence, including the role
            of the Palmach and the political controversy it engendered; the crises which
            followed the establishment of the State of Israel and the politics of the kibbutz
            movement in the early years of independence; and the kibbutzim&#8217;s gradual
            adaptation to their new position in Israeli society and to the problems and
            challenges of a multi-generational society in the late twentieth century.</p>
          <p>Although the detailed narrative ends in 1977 (when the Israeli political system,
            and the status of the kibbutz, underwent a radical change), it is followed by
            a detailed overview describing the many developments which took place between
            1977 and 1995.</p>
          <p>Much of the material is new in any language, and virtually all is new in English.
            Throughout, economic developments, immigration and agricultural settlement,
            political and ideological issues, and internal social developments are presented
            as interdependent and as vitally affected by&#8212;and often affecting&#8212;the
            changing fortunes of the Jewish people, the Zionist movement, and the Jewish
            community in Palestine/Israel. But the kibbutzim are also presented as a special
            instance of a widespread social phenomenon: communal and co-operative societies.</p>

          <p>'<em>Near's achievement in writing this work is to have produced the first complete
  history of the kibbutz movement in English . . . Near accomplished it with what
  seems like an effortless ability . . . Near does an outstanding job of making
  intelligible issues that may not have been clear even to all of the contemporary
  Zionists who struggled with them . . . Near had made a major contribution not
  only to the history of the kibbutz but to the comprehensive history of the Zionist
  movement and the State of Israel. The fact that he is a kibbutz member, yet
  can write so critically and objectively about his subject, is a tribute to the
  author as well. We can only hope that Near continues to toil in this field for
  many years to come.</em>' <br />
Allen Glicksman, <strong>Contemporary Jewry</strong></p>
          <p> '<em>The writing is accessible and reasonably taut. As a narrative, it should
            keep readers intrigued. Sub-headings clearly mark the volume's organization.
            These qualities, combined with the overviews in each chapter, make the volume
            useful for novices and for those moderately familiar with the topic. . . . Although
            the perspective and the range of topics addressed are broad, this is a history
            in a fairly traditional sense. More attention is paid to institutions than to
            experience, to leaders than to ordinary people, to economic organization than
            to social relations of gender or power, and to overall patterns rather than
            to individual kibbutzim. Palestinian Arabs are discussed from the perspective
            of the kibbutz movement-as neighbours, enemies, victims, and so on. Within these
            parameters, the strength of this volume is the way in which it places the trends
            and conflicts within the kibbutz movement and between the kibbutz movement and
            the Jewish world into perspective. This is Near's main task, and he does a fine
            job of it.</em>' <br />

          <p> '<em>About ninety years after the founding of the Deganyah in 1910, Professor
            Henry Near has completed a pioneering and highly important enterprise: the writing
            of a two-volume history of the kibbutz movement . . . [In comparison to previous
            histories of the kibbutzim], Near's originality lies in the broad scope of his
            research, covering all the kibbutz movements and treating various social aspects

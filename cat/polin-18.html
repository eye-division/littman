        <span class="booksubtitle">Jewish Women in Eastern Europe</span><br />
        <span class="author">Edited by ChaeRan Freeze, Paula Hyman &amp; Antony Polonsky</span></p>
  <p>This is the first collection of essays devoted to the study of Jewish  women's experiences in eastern Europe. It attempts to go beyond mere  description of what women experienced and to explore how gender constructed  distinct experiences and identities, seeking thereby to recover lost voices and  place them into a broader analytical framework. It is an important first step  in the rethinking of east European Jewish history with the aid of new insights  gleaned from the research on gender.</p>

      <p>Jewish women's exclusion from the public  domains of religious and civil life has been reflected in their near absence in  the master narratives of the East European Jewish past. As a result, the study  of Jewish women in eastern Europe is still in its infancy. The fundamental task  of historians to construct women as historical subjects, 'as a focus of  inquiry, a subject of the story, an agent of the narrative', has only recently  begun. This volume is the first collection of essays devoted to the study of  Jewish women's experiences in Eastern Europe. <br />
  &nbsp;<br />
        The guest editors for this volume are Paula Hyman of Yale University,  a leading figure in Jewish women&rsquo;s history in the United   States, and ChaeRan Freeze of Brandeis  University, author of a prize-winning  study on Jewish divorce in nineteenth-century Russia. Their introduction provides  a much-needed historiographic survey that summarizes the major work in the  field and highlights the lacunae. Their contributors, following this lead, have  attempted to go beyond mere description of what women experienced to explore  how gender constructed distinct experiences, identities, and meanings. Among  them, Shulamit S. Magnus analyses perhaps the best-known memoir written by an east  European Jewish woman&mdash;Pauline Wengeroff&rsquo;s <em>Memoirs  of a Jewish Grandmother</em>. Ellen Kellman explores the life of a prominent  Jewish feminist whose activism was shaped by the devastating impact of the  First World War. Moshe Rosman considers the question of whether Jewish women in  eastern Europe had power. There are two chapters on the education of Jewish  women in eastern Europe (Eliyana Adler, Carole Balin), and two on Jewish women  who converted to Christianity (ChaeRan Freeze, Rachel Manekin). Tova Cohen  considers how female authors writing in Hebrew encoded their gender concerns in their writing, while Ewa Plach  demonstrates the concerns of cosmopolitan bourgeois and intellectual Jewish  women. Her analysis of a Zionist women&rsquo;s Polish-language feminist newspaper  illustrates the heterogeneity of Polish Jewish womanhood and the hybrid nature  of Jewish identity. </p>
      <p>In seeking to recover lost achievements and voices and place them  into a broader analytical framework, this volume is an important first step in  the rethinking of east European Jewish history with the aid of new insights  gleaned from the research on gender.</p>
      <p>As in earlier volumes of <em>Polin</em>,  substantial space is given, in &lsquo;New Views&rsquo;, to recent research in other areas  of Polish&ndash;Jewish studies, and there is a book review section.</p>

          <p><em>'In many respects, the publication of a collection such as Jewish Women in Eastern Europe signals the emergence of a new area of research. Although scholars of east European Jewry began applying the insights of gender studies to their research relatively recently, the breadth and depth of scholarship showcased in this volume illustrates a commitment to reshaping our understanding of Jewish life in eastern Europe along gender lines. This collection, which is the first in the Polin series to be devoted to gender analysis as well as the first such compilation on east European Jewish women generally, should thus prove foundational in this developing field . . . offers generally high quality articles that will prove interesting to scholars of gender history, Jewish history, and east European Jewish history as well as to advanced students working on relevant topics.' </em><br />
Elana Jakel, <strong>Canadian Slavonic Papers / Revue canadienne des slavistes</strong></p>
          <p><em>&lsquo;In recent years there has been a fair amount of research and  publication on East European Jewish women. Two of the editors of this volume  have taken a leading role in the field and have written path-breaking books on  the topic. However, many of the studies are scattered, and not all are easily  accessible. Therefore, the decision to devote a volume of Polin to the  topic of Jewish women in eastern Europe was very justified. Not surprisingly,  the editors were able to collect some excellent studies that make this book  essential reading for both gender issues and East European Jewish history. The  authors employ a variety of methodologies and use diverse sources. However,  most of the studies can be characterized by a palpable excitement and  enthusiasm for the topic, their readers, and most of all for the subjects of  the papers . . . the introduction is a very comprehensive and readable  historiographical survey written by the editors of the volume. They made a real  effort to integrate the topic of Jewish women in Eastern Europe into both the  general literature about women in the past and the literature on the history of  Jews in Eastern Europe . . . This volume, like the others in the series, is  distinguished by the value and&nbsp; originality of the contributions, the careful  editing, the attractive appearance, and concern for readers. It should be noted  that the volume has a detailed index that includes not only names but topics.  Someone worked hard on it. All in all, this volume of Polin is a very  important contribution to the field and a pleasure to read. What more could one  ask for?&rsquo;</em><br />

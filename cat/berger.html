      <p>This book is a history, an indictment, a lament, and an appeal, focusing
        on the messianic trend in Lubavitch hasidism. It records the shattering
        of one of Judaism's core beliefs and the remarkable equanimity with which
        the standard-bearers of Orthodoxy have allowed it to happen. This is a
        development of striking importance for the history of religions, and it
        is an earthquake in the history of Judaism. David Berger describes the
        unfolding of this historic phenomenon and proposes a strategy to contain

            Yaakov Kermaier, <strong>Tradition</strong></p>
          <p>This book is a history, an indictment, a lament, and an appeal, focusing on
            the messianic trend in Lubavitch hasidism. It demonstrates how hasidim who affirm
            the Rebbe's messiahship have abandoned one of Judaism's core beliefs in favour
            of adherence to the doctrine of a second coming and decries the remarkable equanimity
            with which the standard-bearers of Orthodoxy have granted legitimacy to this
            development by continuing to recognize such believers as Orthodox Jews in good
            standing. This dramatic abandonment of the age-old Jewish resistance to a quintessential
            Christian belief is a development of striking importance for the history of
            religions, and it is an earthquake in the history of Judaism.</p>
          <p>David Berger chronicles the unfolding of this betrayal of Judaism from a personal
            viewpoint, describing the growing concern that impelled him to undertake an
            anti-messianist campaign consisting of publications, correspondence, and the
            sponsorship of a Rabbinical Council of America resolution excluding this belief
            from authentic Judaism. He argues that a large number, almost certainly a substantial
            majority, of Lubavitch hasidim believe in the Rebbe's messiahship and a significant
            segment, including educators in the central institutions of the movement, maintain
            a theology that goes beyond posthumous messianism to the affirmation that the
            Rebbe is pure divinity. While many Jews see Lubavitch itself as a marginal phenomenon,
            it is in fact growing at a remarkable rate to the point where its representatives
            are poised to dominate Orthodox religious institutions not merely in isolated
            outposts but in several major countries throughout the world.</p>
          <p>This book assesses the threat posed by the messianist thrust of this movement,
            points to the consequences (ranging from strengthening the Christian mission
            to undermining the acceptability of purportedly kosher food and ritual objects),
            analyzes the boundaries of Judaism's messianic faith and its conception of God,
            and proposes a strategy to protect authentic Judaism from this assault.</p>

        <p><span class="author">Marc Saperstein</span>      </p>
<p>Wartime sermons offer a window on to how Jews perceive themselves  in relation to the majority society and how Jewish and national values are  reconciled when the fate of a nation is at stake. They also reveal a great deal  about how rabbis guide their communities through the challenges of their times.  The sermons reproduced here were delivered by rabbis from across the Jewish  spectrum, and each is accompanied by a comprehensive introduction and detailed  notes. </p>

          <p>Wartime sermons reveal how Jews perceive themselves in relation to  the majority society and how Jewish and national values are reconciled when the  fate of a nation is at stake. They also illustrate how rabbis guide their  communities through the challenges of their times.</p>
          <p>The sermons reproduced here were delivered by American and British  rabbis from across the Jewish spectrum&mdash;Orthodox to Liberal, Ashkenazi and  Sephardi&mdash;from the Napoleonic Wars to the attacks of 9/11. Each sermon is prefaced by a comprehensive introduction explaining  the context in which it was delivered. Detailed notes explain allusions  unfamiliar to a present-day readership and draw comparisons where appropriate  to similar passages in contemporary newspapers and other sermons. A general  introduction surveys more broadly the distinctive elements of modern Jewish  preaching&mdash;the new preaching occasions bound up with the history of the  countries in which Jews were living; new modes for the dissemination of the  sermons (printed pamphlets and the Jewish and general press), and the emergence  of women&rsquo;s voices from the pulpit. It also surveys the distinctive themes of  modern Jewish sermons, including responses to Jewish suffering, social justice,  eulogies for national leaders, Zionism, and war.</p>
          <p>What Jewish religious leaders said to their congregations when  their countries went to war (or in some cases, were considering going to war)  raises questions of central significance for both modern Jewish history and  religious thinking in the civic context. What evidence do these sermons present  concerning the degree of patriotism felt by Jews? Where and when do we find  examples of dissent from the policies taken by their governments, or explicit criticism?  What theological problems are raised by the preachers in the context of  unprecedented and unimagined destruction, and how do they respond to these  problems? How is the enemy presented in these texts; how is the problem of Jews  fighting and killing other Jews addressed? Are the preachers functioning to  articulate traditions that challenge the consensus of the moment, or as  instruments of social control serving the needs of governments looking for  unquestioning support by their citizenry? In all these areas, this book makes  an important contribution to American- and Anglo-Jewish history of this period  while also making available a collection of mostly unknown Jewish texts  produced at dramatic moments of the past two centuries. </p>

          <p><em>'In this rich collection of  nineteenth- and twentieth-century sermons, Marc Saperstein demonstrates both  the enduring rhetorical power of Jewish preaching and the value of the sermon  as window onto Jewish history . . . a compelling selection . . . He argues  persuasively that Jewish preachers often found themselves confronted with the  challenge of interpreting difficult moral and political questions for their  congregations but that these questions took on particular urgency in moments of  military conflict . . . In reading through this provocative collection of  British and American sermons there are times when one wishes for more . . .  Given the value of the material Saperstein presents here, one can only hope  that other such studies will follow.' &nbsp; &nbsp;</em> <br />
          Jessica Cooperman, <strong>American  Jewish Archives Journal</strong></p>
<p><em>'Sermons brilliantly anthologized by Marc Saperstein . .  . rich collection. The very nature of the book's core source  material&mdash;originally addressed to the Jewish masses&mdash;renders this book eminently  accessible and of natural interest to a very broad readership. At the same  time, Saperstein's extensive historical introductions to each of the sermons,  along with his erudite annotations of these texts, will be of enormous value to  scholars of modern Jewish theology and history.'&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;<br />
            Allan Nadler, <strong>Forward</strong></p>
          <p><em>'Students and scholars of the history of preaching will  find it invaluable. The footnotes and introductions that comprise nearly half  the book are a scholarly tour de force and the 72-page Introduction to the book  as a whole is a riveting overview of elements of Jewish preaching in America  and Great Britain and a stunning example of the use of sermons as data in a  broader history of the intersection between religious groups and civic  life.'</em><br />
            Margaret Moers Wenig, <strong>Homilectic</strong></p>
          <p><em>'Immensely readable . . . a pioneering contribution to the social, religious, and political history of Anglo-Jewry.' </em><br />
            Jeffrey Cohen, <strong>Jewish Chronicle</strong></p>
          <p><em>'Probably the world's greatest expert on Jewish homilectics from the medieval period onwards . . . wide-ranging preface . . . Following a magisterial introduction come the sermons, each one introduced, explained, and discussed as well as sensitively and helpfully annotated. The selections are acute and the sermons themselves potent and highly readable.' </em><br />
          <em><a href="http://www.Middleburgh.co.uk">www.Middleburgh.co.uk</a></em></p>
<p><em>'Marc Saperstein has virtually created a new field of Jewish studies: the scientific study of sermons . . . for having brought together, across the denominational lines that usually separate them, some of the great voices of the past and for having studied their word carefully, both in terms of their context and in terms of what they have to say to us today, we owe Saperstein our gratitude. he has made a genuine contribution to the study of a little-known field of Jewish scholarship.' </em><br />

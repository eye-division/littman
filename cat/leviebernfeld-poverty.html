        <span class="author">Tirtsah Levie Bernfeld</span></p>
      <p>The reputed wealth and benevolence of the Portuguese Jews of early  modern Amsterdam attracted many poor and impoverished&nbsp;people to the city,  both ex-<em>conversos</em> from the Iberian peninsula and Jews from many other  countries. In&nbsp;describing the consequences of that migration in terms of  demography, admission policy, charitable institutions&mdash;public and  private&mdash;philanthropy and daily life,&nbsp;and&nbsp;the dynamics of the  relationship between the rich and the poor,&nbsp;Tirtsah Levie  Bernfeld&nbsp;adds a nuanced new dimension to the&nbsp;understanding of Jewish  life in the early modern period.</p>

          <p>Early modern Amsterdam was a  prosperous city renowned for its relative tolerance, and many people hoping for  a better future, away from persecution, wars, and economic malaise, chose to  make a new life there. Conversos and Jews from many countries were among them,  attracted by the reputed wealth and benevolence of the Portuguese Jews who had  settled there. Behind the facade of prosperity, however, poverty was a serious  problem. It preoccupied the leadership of the Portuguese Jewish community and  influenced its policy on admitting newcomers: the struggle to keep poverty  under control and ensure that finances were available for welfare was  paramount. </p>
          <p>            Tirtsah  Levie Bernfeld looks at poverty and welfare from the perspective of both  benefactors and recipients. She analyses benefactors' motives for philanthropy  and charts its dimensions; she also examines the decision-making processes of  communal bodies and private philanthropists, identifying the cultural  influences that shaped their commitment to welfare. At the same time her  detailed study succeeds in bringing the poor to life: she examines what brought  them to Amsterdam, aspects of their daily life in the petitions they sent to  the different welfare institutions, and the survival strategies offered by  work, education, and charity. She also considers the related questions of  social mobility and the motivation of the poor for joining the Amsterdam  Portuguese community. Her research takes her, finally, beyond the margins of  the established community to the small but active groups of Sephardi bandits  who formed their own clandestine networks. Special attention is also paid to  poor women, whether arriving alone or left behind and sometimes heading small  family units, who were often singled out for relief. In this way the book makes  a much-needed contribution to the study of gender, in Jewish society and more  generally.</p>
          <p>This ground-breaking, multi-faceted study of  the dynamics of the relationship between the rich and the poor adds a nuanced  new dimension to our understanding of Jewish life in the early modern period.</p>
<p><em>'This volume offers the first systematic study of the  poor and poor relief among the Sephardi Jews of early modern Amsterdam. It is a  rich, thorough, and often touching exploration of the topic, and goes far in  correcting the impression that all Jews in this community belonged to wealthy  merchant families. Levie Bernfeld has given a voice to a largely silent but  important population, in a work of meticulous scholarship.'&nbsp;&nbsp;</em> <br />
          Miriam Bodian</p>
          <p><em>'The wealthiest Jewish community in the early modern  period has finally received a comprehensive and detailed study of its poor,  based on a meticulous analysis of a broad variety of sources. Tirtsah Levie  Bernfeld has painted a colourful and fascinating historical portrait of the  poor and ordinary people of the Sephardic community of Amsterdam, with their  social and cultural profile, their distress, and the ways that the community  leadership and its social elite dealt with their disturbing presence. This is  one of the most important contributions in recent years to historical research  on Dutch Jewry as well as on the western Sephardic diaspora.'&nbsp;&nbsp; </em><br />

          <p><em>'The first systematic study of the poor and poor relief in  Sephardic Amsterdam . . . a pioneering work . . . based on a thorough grasp of  all the archival and historical sources . . . convincingly shows that the poor  made up an increasingly greater percentage of the population than previously  thought . . . this major study of Dutch Jewry is highly recommended.'</em><br />
          Harvey Sukenic, <strong>Association of Jewish Libraries Reviews</strong></p>
          <p><em>‘Explores and maps new territory in such an astonishingly thorough manner . . . a splendid example of prodigious research producing a result that illuminates an important aspect of a great Jewish community.’</em><br>

          <p><em>'I consider this to be one of the best and most important  theses I have had the privilege of examining in my career and one of fundamental  importance not just for early modern Dutch Jewish history but for all early  modern Jewish history. I have no doubt at all that her book, which is well  written and clearly set out, will be a landmark in Jewish historiography, an  outstanding work of research which will at the same time be very widely  referred to by Jewish historians of many different kinds. The book is also  impressively erudite, showing a good working knowledge of virtually the entire  primary and secondary published literature pertaining to the Portuguese Jewish  community of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Amsterdam, whether in English,  Dutch, Spanish, Portuguese, or Hebrew. No one has systematically researched the  problem, dimensions, and history of poor relief in the Portuguese Jewish  community of Amsterdam before, and Tirtsah Levie Bernfeld has carried out this  task carefully, thoroughly, and convincingly. She has skillfully utilized the  data she has extracted from the community records and other archival materials  to expand and (in a number of cases) importantly correct our knowledge of the  general demographic, organizational and financial history of the congregation.  Since a majority of those in receipt of poor relief in the Amsterdam Sephardi  community were female, the thesis also makes a relevant and notable  contribution to the history of gender, and of the family, within a Jewish  context.'</em><br />

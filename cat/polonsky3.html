        <span class="author">Antony Polonsky</span>      </p>
    <p>The
        history of the Jewish communities of these lands-where most of the Jews
        of Europe and America originated-is often the subject of woolly thinking
        and stereotypes. Antony Polonsky recreates this lost world in a way that
        avoids both sentimentalism and the simplification of the east European
        Jewish experience into a story of persecution and martyrdom. This is an
        important story whose relevance extends beyond the Jewish world or the
    bounds of east-central Europe.</p>

        <div class="CollapsiblePanelContent">
          <p>Antony Polonsky provides a comprehensive survey of the history - socio-political,
  economic, and religious - of the Jewish communities of eastern Europe from 1750,
  when the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was the dominant political unit, to
  the present. Until the Second World War, this area was the heartland of the
  Jewish world: almost all the major movements which have characterized that world
  in recent times had their origins here, and it was home to the majority of the
  world's Jews. Nearly three and a half million lived in Poland alone, while nearly
  three million more lived in the Soviet Union. </p>
          <p>Although  the majority of the Jews of Europe and the United States, and most of the Jews  of Israel, originated from these lands, the history of their Jewish communities  is not well known. Rather, it is the subject of mythologizing and stereotypes  that fail both to bring out the specific features of the Jewish civilization  which emerged here and to illustrate what was lost in the passage across the  Channel and the Atlantic. Jewish life in these  parts, though often poor materially, was marked by a high degree of spiritual  and ideological intensity and creativity. Antony Polonsky recreates this lost  world&mdash;brutally cut down by the Holocaust and less brutally but still seriously  damaged by the Soviet attempt to destroy Jewish culture&mdash;in a way that avoids  both sentimentalism and the simplification of the the east European Jewish  experience into a story of persecution and martyrdom. Wherever possible, the  unfolding of history is illustrated by contemporary Jewish writings to show how  Jews felt and reacted to the complex and difficult situations in which they  found themselves.</p>
          <p>It  is an important story whose relevance reaches far beyond the Jewish world or  the bounds of east-central Europe. Polonsky  establishes the context with a review of Jewish life in Poland and Lithuania down to the  mid-eighteenth century, describing the towns and shtetls where the Jews lived,  the institutions they developed, and their participation in the economy. He  also considers their religious and intellectual life, including the emergence  of hasidism, and the growth of opposition to it.</p>
          <p>He  then describes government attempts to integrate and transform the Jews in the  period from 1764 to 1881 and the Jewish response to these efforts. He considers  the impact of modernization and the beginnings of the Haskalah movement, and  looks at developments in each area in turn: the problems of emancipation,  acculturation, and assimilation in Prussian and Austrian Poland; the politics  of integration in the Kingdom   of Poland; and the  failure of forced integration in the tsarist empire.</p>
          <p>The  third part of the book considers the deterioration of the position of the Jews  in the period from 1881 to 1914 and the new Jewish politics that led to the  development of new movements: Zionism, socialism, autonomism, the emergence of  modern Hebrew and Yiddish literature, Jewish urbanization, and the rise of  Jewish mass culture. Galicia,  Prussian Poland, the Kingdom   of Poland, and the  tsarist empire are all treated individually, as are the main towns.</p>
          <p>The final part deals with  the twentieth century. Starting from the First World War and the establishment  of the Soviet Union, it deals in turn with Poland,  Lithuania, and the Soviet Union up to the Second World War. It then reviews  Polish&mdash;Jewish relations during the Second World War and examines the Soviet  record and the Holocaust. The final chapters deal with the Jews in the Soviet  Union and in Poland since  1945, concluding with an epilogue on the Jews in Poland,  Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine,  and Russia  since the collapse of communism. </p>

          <p><em>'Powerful roller coaster narrative'</em><br />
          <strong>15 Minutes Magazine</strong></p>
          <p><em>'Polonsky's sweeping study offers  an illuminating, accessible view of Jewish life in eastern Euope since the end  of World War II. In elegant prose, the author engages major historiographical  issues while analyzing important cultural, religious, social, and political  trends among eastern European Jewry. He carefully frames each section with a  chapter-long overview of the relevant historical context for the following  chapters . . . Throughout, Polonsky masterfully navigates the different realms  of a turbulent eastern European Jewish world, conveying both the richness of  its history and the tragedy of its destruction. Highly recommended.'</em><br />
          J.  Haus, <strong>Choice</strong></p>
          <p><em>'Succeeds admirably. Simply put, these volumes are required  reading for anyone with a serious interest in East European history or for  anyone looking for a scholarly assessment of a particular feature of Polish or  Russian Jewish history. Handsomely produced, with extensive maps and tables,  and a glossary . . . will remain a standard work in the field for some time . .  . a body of work that, in summarizing the current state of our knowledge,  effectively sets the agenda for future scholars. Polonsky is perhaps the  scholar most responsible for the growth of Polish Jewish studies in the late  twentieth century . . Very few historians could write a series of volumes like  this . . . [he] has armed scholars with a formidable tool that will help them  dispel stereotypes . . . Just as these volumes are destined to become the  starting point for the work of many students, they will be the touchstone for  scholars working in the field at all levels.'</em> &nbsp; <br />
          Sean Martin, <strong>European  History Quarterly</strong></p>
          <p><em>'Combines a masterful grasp of Jewish history  with that of eastern Europe. While underlining the unique features and  achievements of the Jewish communal experience he authoritatively integrates  them into the history of the countries in which Jews lived . . . Incorporating  current, ground-breaking scholarship from North America, Israel, and Europe  these beautifully narrated volumes should not only be seen as a staple of  university courses, but also as a must-read for anyone attempting to understand  any aspect of modern Jewish history and religious tradition, wherever it may be  playing out . . . With this extremely important book, Antony Polonsky not only  writes history but, following the example of his illustrious predecessors,  makes it.'</em><br />
          Katarzyna Person, <strong>European Judaism </strong></p>
          <p><em>'We can only commend Antony Polonsky for his massive effort to  explain seven centuries of Jewish history in a mere 2,000 pages . . .  Polonsky's strength lies in his ability to illuminate intellectual and cultural  developments . . . Because of the excellent bibliographies, extensive  annotation, and wonderful maps included in each volume, any reader wishing to  read in greater detail about Polish and Russian Jewry will have plenty of  resources to enable the search.'</em><br />
Alexandra S. Korros, <strong>Jewish  Quarterly</strong></p>
<p><em>‛Antony Polonsky's three-volume work is without doubt a remarkable achievement in the study of the history of East European Jewry in general, summarizing not only his quarter-century of intellectual labour on this topic but also the work of his predecessors.’</em><br>
  Serhiy Hirik, <strong>Judaica Ukrainica</strong></p>
          <p><em>'Magisterial . . . all three volumes, but particularly Volume 3, should be of special interest to Polish Americans and all Americans interested in the history of the Jews in Poland, Lithuania, and Russia.' </em><br />
          Anna M. Cienciala, <strong>Polish Review</strong></p>
          <p><em>'Definitive . . . The scope is immense and the author does an  impressive job of synthesizing a vast literature . . . This trilogy will no  doubt serve as a standard history of east European Jewry for a long time.'</em><br />
          Shaul Stampfer, <strong>Religious Studies Review</strong></p>
<p><em>'Exemplary and formidable . . . Polonsky, as much as anyone  else, has created the field of modern Jewish history as a subject to be  considered and understood rather than simply a tragic past to be mourned. He is  too good a historian to confuse the history of Jewish life with the German  policies that brought Jewish death . . . The barely visible commitment in these  three wonderful volumes is to rescue a world from polemic, for the sake of  history.' </em><br />
            Timothy Snyder, <strong>Wall Street Journal</strong></p>
            <p><em>‘The first serious, and most successful, effort thus far to summarize the history of the Jews of “Eastern Europe” . . . the first book to synthesize the vast research that has emerged since the seventies . . . comprehensive and multidisciplinary . . . there is no book today that can compare to its scope and to the vast and new materials that he brings forth and analyzes with a broad imagination, an intensive approach, and a moderate style.’</em><br />

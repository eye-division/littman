        Forward by Raymond Scheindlin
      </p>
    <p>The  poems of the Golden Age of Spanish Jewry (950-1200) offer a vivid  representation of contemporary Jewish life as well as a deep consciousness of Israel&rsquo;s  relationship with God and an intense concern with the fate of the Jewish  people. This volume conveys the greatness of that literature through the work  of thirteen poets.</p>

          <p>The  years 950-1200 are often called the Golden Age of the Jews in Spain. During  this period, the Jews reached a peak of achievement in all aspects of their  life&mdash;political, spiritual, and cultural. They produced great works of  literature and philosophy; their poetry represents a peak of literary  achievement unparalleled in Hebrew until the twentieth century.</p>
          <p>The  poets of the Golden Age forged the language of the Hebrew Bible into a  magnificent instrument for the expression of every facet of their  experience--love and friendship, war and exile, philosophy and prayer. Their  poems reflect their overarching consciousness of Israel&rsquo;s relationship with God and  their deep concern with the fate of the Jewish people in exile. Not until  modern times did Hebrew poetic genius flourish again with such freedom and with  such intensity.</p>
          <p>This  volume conveys in modern English something of the greatness of that literature  while as far as possible preserving the poetic values and beauty of the Hebrew  original. Brief notes on the work of each of the thirteen poets represented put  the poems in their proper perspective and do much to elucidate their meaning. </p>
          <p>The  poets included are Dunash Halevi ben Labrat, Joseph ibn Abithur, Isaac ibn  Kalpon, Samuel Hanagid, Solomon ibn Gabirol, Isaac ibn Gi&rsquo;at, Moses ibn Ezra,  Judah Halevi, Abraham ibn Ezra, Joseph ibn Zabara, Judah Alharizi, Shem Tob ben  Palquera, and Todros ben Judah Abulafia.</p>
          <p>&lsquo;<em>Remains the only anthology in English devoted entirely to the  Golden Age with selections from all the major and some minor poets presented in  verse translations. The book is a gift to the academic world and to all readers  interested in the literary achievements of the Jews.</em>&rsquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the Foreword by Raymond Scheindlin.</p>

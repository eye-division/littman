 <h1>British Jewry and the Holocaust</h1>
<p><span class="booksubtitle">With a new Introduction</span><br />

<p><em>'Admirable
        . . . it works splendidly well . . . [an] impressive, noble, and genuinely
      important book.'</em> <br />
        Andrew Chandler, <strong>English Historical Review</strong> </p>
      <p><em>'This is absorbing, frightening, upsetting, essential reading. If
        Anglo-Jewry is to acquire a conviction about its values, this period of
        history must be re-examined; those institutions which so failed fellow-Jews
        must be reassessed; routes to influence within the Jewish community must
        be questioned. Finally, those who still remember those days must be asked,
        before it is too late, why so little was done.'</em> <br />
        Julia Neuberger, <strong>The Times </strong></p>
      <p>How did British Jewry respond to the Holocaust, how prominent was the
        Holocaust on the communal agenda, and what does this response tell us
        about the values, politics, fears, and identity of the Anglo-Jewish community?
        This book studies the priorities of that community, and thereby seeks
        to analyse the attitudes and philosophies which informed actions. It paints
        a picture of Anglo-Jewish life and its reactions to a wide range of matters
        in the external, non-Jewish world. For this paperback, the author has
        added a new Introduction summarizing research in the field since the book&#8217;s
        first appearance.</p>

            in wartime Britain.'</em><br />

          <p><em>'Not simply a narrative of Jewish and by necessity non-Jewish attitudes

            Harold Steinhof, <strong>Jewish Book News &amp; Reviews</strong></p>
          <p> How did British Jewry respond to the Holocaust, how prominent was it on the communal agenda, and what does this response tell us about the values, politics, and fears of the Anglo-Jewish community? This book studies the priorities of that community, and thereby seeks to analyse the attitudes and philosophies which informed actions. It paints a picture of Anglo-Jewish life and its reactions to a wide range of matters in the non-Jewish world. </p>
          <p>Richard Bolchover charts the transmission of the news of the European catastrophe and discusses the various theories regarding reactions to these exceptional circumstances. He investigates the structures and political philosophies of Anglo-Jewry during the war years and covers the reactions of Jewish political and religious leaders as well as prominent Jews acting outside the community&rsquo;s institutional framework. Various co-ordinated responses, political and philanthropic, are studied, as are the issues which dominated the community at that time, namely internal conflict and the fear of increased domestic antisemitism: these preoccupations inevitably affected responses to events in Europe. The latter half of the book looks at the ramifications of the community&rsquo;s socio-political philosophies including, most radically, Zionism, and their influence on communal reactions. This acclaimed study raises major questions about the structures and priorities of the British Jewish community. </p>
          <p>For this paperback, the author has added a new Introduction summarizing research in the field since the book&rsquo;s first appearance.</p>

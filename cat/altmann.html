          <p><em>'Altmann's creative work excels in many respects. It is history par excellence.
            It is thorough research. It is unsparing in criticism and it recognizes the

            <strong>Detroit Jewish News</strong></p>
          <p> Alexander Altmann&#8217;s acclaimed, wide-ranging biography of Moses Mendelssohn
            (1729&#8211;96) was first published in 1973, but its stature as the definitive
            biography remains unquestioned. In fact, there has been no subsequent attempt
            at an intellectual biography of this towering and unusual figure: no other Jew
            so deeply rooted in the Jewish tradition was at the same time so much a part
            of the intellectual life of the German Enlightenment in the second half of the
            eighteenth century. As such, Moses Mendelssohn came to be recognized as the
            inaugurator of a new phase in Jewish history; all modern Jews today are in his
            debt.</p>
          <p>Altmann presents Moses Mendelssohn in strictly biographical terms. He does
            not attempt to assess his significance with the hindsight of historical perspective
            nor to trace his image in subsequent generations, but rather to observe his
            life from the period within which it was set. Altmann has written an absorbing
            and compelling narrative that makes a whole epoch come alive with great drama,
            for Mendelssohn&#8217;s life was a kaleidoscope of the European intellectual
            scene, Jewish and non-Jewish. As both a prominent philosopher and a believing
            Jew, Mendelssohn became a spokesman for the Jews and Judaism; he was one of
            the rare figures who become the symbol of an era. Through Altmann&#8217;s skilful
            use of hitherto unpublished archival material, the reader is introduced to the
            vast array of people&#8212;men of letters, artists, politicians, scientists,
            philosophers, and theologians&#8212;with whom Mendelssohn was in contact, and
            sometimes in conflict.</p>
          <p>What was Mendelssohn&#8217;s Judaism like? To what extent did the disparate
            worlds of Judaism and modern Enlightenment jostle each other in his mind and
            to what degree could he harmonize them? These questions are not easily answered,
            and it is only in the aggregate of a multitude of accounts of experiences, reaction,
            and statements on his part that the answer is to be found. Alexander Altmann&#8217;s
            analysis of this wealth of material is extraordinary in its discernment, subtlety,
            and clarity of expression.</p>
          <p>This masterly work will be of interest not only to those who are concerned
            with Jewish intellectual history but also to those interested in eighteenth-century
            cultural and social history, philosophy and theology, literary criticism, aesthetics,
            and the other areas of intellectual activity in ferment at that time. The general
            reader will also find much of contemporary relevance in Mendelssohn&#8217;s
            life, not only because of his exemplary devotion to reason and tolerance, but
            also because of his lifelong struggle with the basic dilemma of the Jew in the
            modern world: the attraction of assimilation versus the singularity of Jewish
            life, and the preservation of Jewish identity versus integration in the wider
            society.</p>

<h3>About the author</h3>
      <p><strong>Alexander Altmann </strong> (1906-87) was born in Hungary and educated
        at the Rabbinical Seminary, Berlin, and at the University of Berlin. In
        1938 he left Germany for Manchester, England, where he was appointed communal
        rabbi. While in Manchester he founded the Institute of Jewish Studies
        that later moved to University College, London. In 1959 he was appointed
        Professor of Jewish Philosophy at Brandeis University, Massachusetts,
    and Director of its Lown Institute of Advanced Judaic Studies.</p>
      <p>A Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, his numerous publications
        in English, Hebrew, and German range over such diverse fields as classical
        rabbinic literature, medieval Judaeo-Arabic philosophy, Jewish mysticism,
        eighteenth-century Enlightenment, and modern Jewish thought. Among his
        significant contributions to the history of Jewish thought are <em>Saadya
        Gaon: The Book of Doctrines and Beliefs</em> (1946), <em>Studies in Religions,
        Philosophy and Mysticism</em> (1969), and <em>Studies in Jewish Intellectual
        History</em> (1981).</p>
      <p>In later years, much of Professio Altmann's scholarly work focused on
        Moses Mendelssohn and the period of the German Enlightenment, and he took
        over the editorship of Mendelssohn's <em>Gesammelte Schriften</em> (collected
        works). In 1979, the 250th anniversary of Mendelssohn's birth, he delivered
        the key lecture in Berlin on 'Enlightenment and Culture' at the ceremony
        marking the city's celebration of Mendelssohn's life.      </p>

          <p>'<em>Alexander Altmann's monumental new biography not only supersedes the Kayserling
            study but should also serve as a turning point in the historical re-evaluation
            of Mendelssohn's role in the process of Jewish emancipation . . . The happy
            combination of all these qualities in Professor Altmann makes his work a major
            achievement of scholarship.</em>' <br />
            Jacob Katz, <strong>Commentary</strong></p>
          <p> '<em>There is an overpowering effect on the reader in studying the results
            of Professor Altmann's facts compiled as a biography and emerging as so much
            more: as history, as a record of controversies over religious adherence and
            strict and faithful Jewish observance, as theological disputation, as remarkable
            reporting on the philosophic discourses with noted Christians as well as Jews,
            as commentary on Jewish laws by the hero of the book whose piety and Jewish
            devotions are respected to this day . . . Altmann's creative work excels in
            many respects. It is history par excellence. It is thorough research. It is

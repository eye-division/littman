          <p><em>'Magnificent . . . a consummate work of scholarship . . . to be read as
  well as to be dipped into and also to have as a major reference work.'</em> <br />
Alex Auswaks, <strong>Jerusalem Post </strong></p>
          <p>Hasidism has been a seminal force and source of controversy in the Jewish world
            since its inception in the second half of the eighteenth century. Indeed, almost
            every ideological trend that has made itself felt among Jews since that time-from
            Zionism and Orthodoxy to contemporary Jewish feminism and movements within the
            yeshiva world-has claimed to have derived some inspiration from this vibrant
            movement. While this is sure testimony to its vitality and originality, it has
            also given rise to many misconceptions as to what hasidism is about. </p>
          <p>This major work, the first comprehensive critical study of hasidism in English,
            offers a wide-ranging treatment of the subject in all its aspects by what is
            effectively the entire present generation of scholars working in the field.
            With contributions ranging from the history of theology and of ideas through
            social and economic history to contemporary sociology, <em>Hasidism Reappraised</em> encompasses a complete field of modern scholarship in a discipline that is central
            to the understanding of modern Jewish history and the contemporary Jewish world.</p>
          <p> The twenty-eight authors who have contributed to the main body of the book
            are almost without exception established scholars with international reputations.
            The volume as a whole is dedicated to the memory of Joseph Weiss, and its opening
            section assesses his contribution to the study of hasidism in the context of
            his relationship with Gershom Scholem and Scholem's long-standing influence
            on the field. The remaining contributions are arranged thematically under seven
            headings: the social history of hasidism; the social functions of mystical ideals
            in the hasidic movement; distinctive outlooks and schools of thought within
            hasidism; the hasidic tale; the history of hasidic historiography; contemporary
            hasidism; and the present state of research on hasidism. The book also incorporates
            an extensive introduction that places the various articles in their intellectual
            context, as well as a bibliography of hasidic sources and contemporary scholarly
            literature.</p>
          <p><em>Hasidism Reappraised</em> shows an intellectual world at an important juncture
            in its development and points to the direction in which scholarly study of hasidism
            is likely to develop in the years to come.</p>

          <p>'<em>Ce fort volume . . . Cet ouvrage repr&eacute;sente sans conteste une &eacute;tape
  importante pour la connaissance du hasidisme.</em>' <br />
Jacques Gutwirth,<strong> Archives des Sciences Sociales des Religions</strong></p>
          <p> '<em>A magnificent account of that phenomenon from the Jewish past - Hasidism.
            Not only is it a consummate work of scholarship, but the editor has drawn together
            some of the personal relationships between scholars to show how this has also
            been the yeast in the splendid lekakh. Before all else, a word of praise for
            the editor . . . to be read as well as to be dipped into and also to have as
            a major reference work. Trawling the index alone kept me fascinated for many
            evenings. Some wealthy Jews build synagogues, Jewish centres, but Louis Thomas
            Sidney Littman, who founded the Littman Library for the love of God and in memory
            of his father, gave us the wisest gift of all. Our richest past. His memory
            for a blessing. Ada Rapoport-Albert is an Israeli lecturer at University College,
            London. She is a considerable editor, writer, and scholar, and by all personal
            accounts an inspired teacher.'</em> <br />
            Alex Auswaks,<strong> Jerusalem Post</strong></p>
          <p> '<em>Probably the most important analytical study of the Hasidic movement to
            have appeared in the English language, and it can be read with profit by anyone
            seriously interested in Jewish history.</em>'<br />
            Edgar Samuel, <strong>Jewish Historical Studies</strong></p>
          <p>'<em>Undoubtedly of great value for our knowledge of hasidism.</em>' <br />
            Jacques Gutwirth, <strong>Jewish Journal of Sociology</strong></p>
          <p> '<em>An opportunity to encounter virtually all the most important trends in
            the study of Hasidism and to move beyond the approaches and theories that have
            until now constituted conventional wisdom . . . It is a volume that will be
            essential for anyone with a serious interest in Hasidism and indeed for any
            Judaica collection.</em>' <br />
            Miles Krassen, <strong>Journal of Jewish Studies</strong></p>
          <p> '<em>Handsome collection of twenty-eight essays by world-ranking scholars .
            . . comprehensive indeed, and profound, articulate, often gripping, and frequently
            counter to conventional wisdom . . . amply rewarded by the superb job of translating,

  for non-traditional or secular Jews who wish better to understand an observant
  Jew's perspective on the diverse Judaisms of modernity.'</em><br />
A. J. Avery-Peck, <strong>Choice </strong></p>
          <p><em>One People?</em> is the first book-length study of the major problem confronting
            the Jewish future: the availability or otherwise of a way of mending the schisms
            between Reform and Orthodox Judaism, between religious and secular Jews in Israel,
            and between Israel itself and the diaspora-all of which have been deepened by
            the fierce and continuing controversy over the question of 'who is a Jew?' </p>
          <p><em>One People?</em> is a study of the background to this and related controversies.
            It traces the fragmentation of Jewry in the wake of the Enlightenment, the variety
            of Orthodox responses to these challenges, and the resources of Jewish tradition
            for handling diversity. Having set out the background to the intractability
            of the problems, it ends by examining the possibilities within Jewish thought
            that might make for convergence and reconciliation. </p>
          <p>The Chief Rabbi employs a variety of disciplines-history, sociology, theology,
            and halakhic jurisprudence-to clarify a subject in which these dimensions are
            inextricably interwoven. He also explores key issues such as the underlying
            philosophy of Jewish law, and the nature of the collision between tradition
            and modern consciousness. </p>
          <p>Written for the general reader as much as the academic one, this is a lucid
            and thought-provoking presentation of the dilemmas of Jewish Orthodoxy in modernity.</p>

  book, is recommended, especially for non-traditional or secular Jews who wish

  of modernity.</em>' <br />
A. J. Avery-Peck, <strong>Choice</strong></p>
          <p> '<em>We are indebted to Rabbi Sacks for presenting us with a closely reasoned
            argument helping the modern Orthodox Jew resolve the dilemma of wanting to live
            with his non-observant neighbours with mutual respect, and at the same time
            retaining his unqualified commitment to his faith in Tora min Hashamayim and
            all that that implies</em>.'<br />
            Mendell Lewittes,<strong> Jerusalem Post Magazine</strong></p>
          <p> '<em>It is admirable that an Orthodox Chief Rabbi should be searching-with
            halachic backing-for ways of uniting all Jewish factions.'</em> <br />
            Stefan Reif, <strong>Jewish Chronicle</strong></p>
          <p> '<em>A tour de force. Brilliantly documented and skilfully presented, it looks
            honestly at the Jewish experience of the past in order to find a resolution
            to the problems that today threaten the Jewish people with dissolution. Rabbi
            Sacks asserts in the preface that, &quot;in writing about Liberal, Reform, Conservative,
            and Reconstructionist Judaisms, I have tried to come to terms with positions
            that are fundamentally not my own.&quot; He is, I believe, the first Orthodox rabbi
            in a position of authority ever to do so, and for this he deserves our praise
            . . . One People? is essential reading for all who wish to establish the basis
            for a constructive dialogue between the various religious sections in Jewry
            . . . for those who truly love Klal Yisrael, his is the only reasonable way
            forward.</em>'<br />
            Sidney Brichto,<strong> Jewish Chronicle</strong></p>
          <p>'<em>His approach marks a refreshing change from those engaged in theological
            backbiting, and it bears out his desire to seek reconciliation between the different
            creeds of Judaism . . . Chief Rabbi Sacks is to be praised for opening up the
            process of reconciliation within Anglo-Jewry in a reasoned and dignified manner.</em>' <br />
            Jonathan Romain,<strong> Jewish Chronicle</strong></p>
          <p> '<em>Sober, realistic, even optimistic. It is also splendidly written, closely
            reasoned and meticulously documented . . . All of us can-and should-accept that
            the Chief Rabbi's motives are good</em>.'<br />
            John Rayner,<strong> Jewish Chronicle </strong></p>
          <p>'<em>Any sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu is soon eclipsed by the increased tightness
            and depth of the argument, apparent not least in the uncanny way in which any
            counter-argument is either anticipated or raised and dealt with later in the
            text . . . There is thus scope for much future discussion. This book makes its
            case against a deftly woven background of the history, sociology, theology and
            Halakha of the past two centuries. Its argument is brilliantly sustained through
            its compelling paradoxes which at times illuminate and at times provoke . .
            . Sacks has confronted the questions which most profoundly trouble contemporary
            Jewish existence. His book redraws the conceptual field in which the arguments
            will continue even if it is unlikely to end them. This is no small contribution.</em>'<br />
            Michael Gillis, <strong>Jewish Quarterly</strong></p>
          <p> '<em>An intellectual and philosophical feast of scholastic diplomacy. Diplomat
            par excellence, Sacks seeks to forge bridges over the seemingly unbridgeable
            chasms separating Orthodoxy, Progressive Judaism and Jewish secularism, as well
            as within Orthodoxy itself . . . a masterly exercise which, it is hoped, will
            not fall on the deaf ears of a Jewry too divided to love itself . . . a valiant
            attempt to occupy the pivotal middle ground of Jewry - a stance which demands
            courage in an age such as ours which favours extremism. Let us hope that all
            sections of Jewry will accept the hand of friendship and understanding stretched
            out to them by Sacks so that maybe one day we just might become One People.</em>'<br />
            <strong>Jewish Telegraph</strong></p>
          <p> '<em>Jonathan Sacks has had the courage to elaborate a major constituent of
            his personal credo before the public gaze . . . it is not dispassionately reasoned
            but is an expression of a devout commitment to the cause of unity . . . Even
            if Jonathan Sacks has raised more questions than he has answered, if we are
            prepared to address these questions to ourselves, he has thereby rendered a
            service to each of us, and so let us hope, to all of us, what he calls the &quot;covenantal
            community&quot;, keneset Yisrael.</em>'<br />

          <p> When Queen Victoria came to the throne in 1837, Britain was home to only 30,000
            Jews and they did not yet have full political rights. By the end of the century
            their numbers had increased about sevenfold, and practising Jews had taken their
            places in both the House of Commons and the House of Lords. Victoria&#8217;s
            reign therefore saw a tremendous change in the profile of Jews within British
            society.</p>
          <p>The Victorian period was also one of economic transition for British Jews.
            While initially in a narrow range of predominantly working-class or marginal
            occupations with only a small upper-class &eacute;lite, Jews became increasingly
            middle-class during these years; they began to enter the professions, and to
            move from inner London to fashionable suburbs. Increasingly, Britain's Jews
            were British-born and of British descent, and proclaimed their loyalty to British
            ideals. From 1881 on, however, the position changed dramatically: a mass of
            Jewish immigrants arriving from Russia, made conspicuous by their foreign dress,
            appearance, language, and habits, prompted the emergence of an &#8216;Aliens
            Question&#8217; into the British political arena. The image of Jews changed
            yet again.</p>
          <p>All these developments were picked up in the illustrated magazines of the time:
            the object of a magazine is to interest its readers, and the unfamiliar may
            be more compelling reading than the commonplace. To illustrate the social history
            of the Jews in Victorian Britain, the authors therefore combed the Illustrated
            London News, Punch, and The Graphic and selected nearly 150 illustrations, with
            commentary, to show how the British image of the Jew developed in this period.
            The topics considered include early Victorian attitudes to Jews; the leading
            Jewish families and other prominent Jews; the Jewish way of life; immigrant
            Jews; Jewish life abroad; and the Jew in art.</p>
          <p>An introductory essay by the late V. D. Lipman, formerly Director of Ancient
            Monuments and Historic Buildings for England and an Honorary Research Fellow
            of University College London, gives a comprehensive overview of the status of
            Jews in nineteenth-century Britain.</p>

<h3>About the author</h3>
      <p><strong>Anne Cowen</strong> was educated at University College London and at the
        City University Business School. She was Senior Lecturer in Economics
        and Industrial Relations at the Polytechnic of Central London. She has
        also undertaken economic research and business consultancy work, and is
        currently involved in running a small business. She has lectured widely
        on 'Victorian Jews through British eyes' and related themes, including
        at the Museum of London and Jewish Book Week, and on BBC radio. She is
        involved in a wide range of communal educational and charitable work,
        and is a Trustee of the New London Synagogue.<br />
        <br />
        The late <strong>Roger Cowen</strong> was educated at the University of Manchester
        and received an MBA from Columbia University Business School. He pursued
        a very creative and successful business career, and had a wide range of
        interests in the arts and communal activities. He died in 1986. <br />
        A keen photographer, Roger Cowen, with Anne Cowen, visited many small
        provincial synagogues in the United Kingdom and researched their histories.
        Their visits to antiques shops and bookshops proved a pleasurable activity
        and yielded much of the material used in this book.      </p>

        <span class="author">Seymour Feldman</span>      </p>
  <p>The philosopher,  astronomer, and biblical exegete known both as Gersonides&nbsp;and  Ralbag (1288-1344) wrote a veritable library of works that testify not  only to the breadth of his intellectual concerns but to his attempt to forge  a synthesis between the secular sciences and&nbsp;Judaism. This is the  first English-language study to assess his place and significance for Jewish  thought, and it offers a comprehensive picture of his philosophy that is both  descriptive and evaluative.      </p>

        <div class="CollapsiblePanelContent">
          <p>Gersonides  (1288-1344), known also&nbsp;as&nbsp;Ralbag, was a philosopher of the first  rank as well as an astronomer and biblical exegete, yet this is the first  English-language study&nbsp;of&nbsp;the significance of his work for Jewish  thought.&nbsp;Seymour Feldman, the acclaimed translator of Gersonides' most  important work, The Wars of the Lord---a complete philosophical system  and astronomical encyclopedia---has written&nbsp;a comprehensive picture  of&nbsp;Gersonides' philosophy that is both descriptive and evaluative.</p>
          <p><span color:purple="color:purple"'>Unusually for a Jewish scholar,&nbsp;Gersonides had contacts with  several Christian notables and scholars. It is known that these&nbsp;related to  mathematical and astronomical matters; the extent to which these contacts also  influenced his&nbsp;philosophical thought&nbsp;is a matter of some controversy.  Unquestionably, however,&nbsp;he&nbsp;wrote a veritable&nbsp;library of  philosophical, scientific, and exegetical works that testify not only to the  range of his intellectual concerns but also to his attempt to forge a  philosophical-scientific synthesis between these secular sciences  and&nbsp;Judaism. Unlike many modern scientists or philosophers, who either  scorn religion or compartmentalize it,&nbsp;he did not see any fundamental  discrepancy&nbsp;between the pursuit of truth via reason and its attainment  through divine revelation: there is only one truth, with which both reason and  revelation must agree. As a philosopher-scientist and biblical exegete  Gersonides sought to make this agreement robustly evident.</span></p>
          <p>While philosophical and scientfic ideas have progressed since  Gersonides' time,&nbsp;his work is still relevant today because his attempt to  make prophecy and miracles understandable in terms of some commonly held  philosophical or scientific theory is paradigmatic of a religion that is not  afraid of reason. His general principle that reason should function as a  'control' of what we believe has interesting and important implications for the  modern reader.&nbsp;Indeed, some of his basic arguments are&nbsp;favoured by  many contemporary thinkers who attempt to incorporate modern science into their  religious belief system. He was not afraid to make religious beliefs  philosophically and scientifically credible; one could say that&nbsp;he  pursued&nbsp;an 'ethics of belief' in that he held that there are constraints  to what is believable, especially in religion. In this respect&nbsp;he was a  precursor of Kant and Hermann Cohen: Judaism is or should be a religion of  reason.</p>

    <div class="CollapsiblePanelContent">
      <p><em>'Will be welcomed by all serious  students of Jewish thought . . . definitely worth the effort. Recommended.'</em><br />
        Barry Dov Walfish, <strong>AJL Reviews</strong> </p>
      <p><em>'An extremely welcome, important,  and long-overdue addition to the literature . . . the first monograph in  English to look at a broad range of Gersonides' philosophical ideas . . .  Feldman does a terrific job of exposition and philosophical examination. His  analyses are clear and accessible without being over-simplified. He does great  justice to Gersonides' thought, as well as to its historico-philosophical  contexts. The book is also a pleasure to read. This is just the kind of study  on Gersonides that we have long needed, and one can only hope that it will draw  more philosophers toward this seminal figure too long ignored by  non-specialists.'</em><br />
        Steven Nadler,<strong><em> British Journal for the History of  Philosophy</em><em></em></strong> </p>
      <p><em>'Without  question Feldman presents a superb summary of the totality of Gersonides'  Jewish philosophy in a single volume that is carefully reasoned and clearly  written. Certainly no philosophers or intellectual historians of medieval  thought can consider themselves academically literate without at least some  familiarity with the writings of Gersonides, and Feldman does a better job than  anyone else in providing a reliable foundation for that minimal philosophical  knowledge. His book should become a standard text.'</em><br />
        Norbert Samuelson,<strong><em> H-Judaic</em><em></em></strong> </p>
      <p>        <em>'An impressive achievement . . a  useful book for anyone interested in medieval Jewish philosophy, either  specialist or novice.' &nbsp;&nbsp;Jewish Book World<br />
        'A  succinct conspectus of Gersonides' positions on the pivotal issues of medieval  Jewish philosophy and the arguments he offers in their favour . . . Feldman's  style is lucid and engaging. In the course of contrasting Gersonides with  Maimonides, who, Gersonides felt, begged some important questions, Feldman  offers some valuable insights from which the myriad of Maimonidean specialists  may yet profit.'</em><br />
        Y. Tzvi Langermann, <strong>Journal of the History of  Philosophy</strong></p>
      <p>        <em>'A comprehensive survey . . .  reflects a deep and thorough acquaintance with the philosophical, as well as  with the Jewish tradition. The book therefore is both an inviting introduction  for students and an important contribution to research that should be read by  historians of Jewish philosophy.'</em><br />
        Ruth Glasner, <strong>Shofar</strong></p>

        <p><em>‘A comprehensive look at one of the most formidable Jewish philosophers.’</em><br>
          Ben Rothke, <strong>Times of Israel</strong></p>

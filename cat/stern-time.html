      and Process in Ancient Judaism</h1>
        <p><span class="author">Sacha Stern</span></p>
  <p>This comprehensive study of time, time-reckoning, and chronology  in ancient Jewish sources demonstrates that the concept of time as an entity or  a continuum was entirely absent from ancient Judaism. Reality and change were  conceived in terms of concrete processes. This stands in contrast with the  world-view of Graeco-Roman culture and its pervasive concept of <em>chronos</em>, but finds parallels in the  cultures of the ancient Near East. Sacha Stern discusses these findings from a  variety of historical and anthropological perspectives.</p>

      <p><em>'Time  and Process in Ancient Judaism is an original and sophisticated study of a  subject that is of considerable importance for historians of the relationship  of Jews to Graeco-Roman culture in late antiquity.'&nbsp;</em><br />
        <strong>Martin Goodman</strong></p>
      <p>This illuminating study is about the  absence of a concept of time in ancient Judaism, and the predominance instead  of process in the ancient Jewish world-view. Sacha Stern draws his evidence  from the complete range of Jewish sources from this period: mainly early  rabbinic literature, but also Jewish Hellenistic literature, Qumran  sources, Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha, and inscriptions.</p>
      <p>Following a methodological introduction drawing on anthropological  studies, the author starts by focusing on the word used for time in early  rabbinic literature, zeman. He shows  that it means only &lsquo;points in time&rsquo; or finite periods of time, but that the  concept of time as a continuum&mdash;of time as a whole&mdash;is totally absent from  rabbinic texts. It is unknown even in such obvious contexts as discussions of  age, accounts of the creation of the universe, and in other matters relating to  timing and time reckoning, the calendar, and chronology. He shows convincingly  that although timing was central to early rabbinic halakhah, it was not  conceived of as a measuring of the time dimension, but rather as a way of  co-ordinating different processes (e.g. co-ordinating the reading of the Shema with sunrise or dusk). The calendar,  likewise, was not a measurement of time but an astronomical scheme, and  therefore only process-related. Similar conclusions apply to early rabbinic  notions of chronology, history, and even ethics: the notion of time as an  entity or a resource, so familiar in modern society, is completely unknown in  rabbinic ethics.</p>
      <p>Further confirmation emerges from the author's study of  non-rabbinic ancient Jewish sources in Greek, Hebrew and Aramaic, including  Apocryphal and Pseudepigraphic works and Dead Sea Scrolls, sources that are  also concerned with the calendar and chronology but without any notion of time per se. The absence of a concept of time  is also attested in other Near eastern cultures, but stands in contrast to  Graeco-Roman culture with its pervasive concept of chronos. The ancient Jewish view also stands in contrast with  medieval Judaism, when the concept of time became well established in ethics,  philosophy, biblical exegesis, and halakhah, a development which Stern  attributes partly to the influence of Greek philosophy on medieval Jewish  thinkers. He concludes with reflections on the wider implications of these  findings, especially regarding the limited Hellenization of ancient Judaism and  its cultural isolation within the Graeco-Roman world.</p>
      <p>This perceptive work, clearly, cogently,  and convincingly argued, offers a new perspective on the world-view of ancient  Judaism and its links with other cultures in the Near East  of late antiquity.</p>

          <p><em>'This excellent, illuminating, insightful, perceptive, cogently argued, clearly written book is one of the most interesting books I have read in a long time, offering a new perspective on the world-view of ancient Judaism and its links with other cultures of the Near East of late antiquity. Stern casts his new wide and his findings are intriguing . . . Readers may find this book a source of delight and astonishing breadth, one that they cannot put down. It makes an original contribution to the fields of Rabbinics and Jewish studies. It is also cross-disciplinary with the fields of philosophy, classics, history of ideas, history in general, and anthropology.' </em><br />

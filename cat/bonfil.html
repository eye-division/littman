          <p>Focusing on the figure of the rabbi, this book provides a vivid picture of
            Italian Jewry during the Renaissance. The author discusses Jewish life of the
            period (<em>c.</em> 1450-1600) in its social, institutional, and cultural aspects,
            placing them against the backdrop of the wider Catholic environment to give
            an original interpretation of how Jewish cultural and religious life developed
            in the Renaissance context. Particular attention is given to changes in the
            status and functions of the rabbis and to the relations between the rabbinate
            and the lay leadership. Of special interest is the exploration of the cultural
            world of the rabbis and the broader issue of intellectual developments at the
            time. </p>
          <p>Essentially a translation of Part I of the Hebrew edition, which won wide acclaim
            for its perspective, <em>Rabbis and Jewish Communities in Renaissance Italy</em> has been carefully adapted for an English-speaking readership. Substantial excerpts
            from the appendices have been incorporated into the text so that the evidence
            necessary to support the arguments is easily accessible.</p>

          <p>'<em>Bonfil's chapter on the function of the rabbis within the Jewish legal
  system in Italy is an important contribution to an understanding of the actual
  authority and legal basis of the fledgling Jewish communities of fifteenth-sixteenth
  century Italy . . . There is so much that is praiseworthy about Bonfil's achievement.
  The reader of the book is immediately struck by the multitude of detail, and
  the richness and diversity of the source material utilized by the author . .
  . it is the attainment of a seasoned historian with an impressive familiarity
  with his sources. It is also the product of a scholar with a broad knowledge
  of the intellectual and social context of Christian Italy who is capable of
  applying his knowledge to a greater understanding of the Jewish community .
  . . It is indeed refreshing to read an historical work with such integrative
  and synthetic powers, especially when written in a crisp, lively style . . .
  splendid contribution . . . it is a tribute to a major work which should become
  a standard interpretation of an important period in Jewish history . . . the
  book will remain a major frame of reference for all future research.</em>' <br />

            with their communities . . . will be read with great interest by community Rabbis
            in particular, striking chords of recognition of many issues that still lurk

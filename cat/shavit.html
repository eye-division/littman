            Mordechai Beck,<strong> Jerusalem Post</strong></p>
          <p>From the eighteenth century on, Jews seeking to acquire a modern identity began
            to take a new interest in classical antiquity and Hellenistic civilization as
            a key to the secular Jewish culture they sought to develop. It was of course
            not the &#8216;real&#8217; classical Greece to which they aspired but rather
            its idealized image as perceived through contemporary eyes, but this image became
            an important element in the search for a new Jewish self-awareness. For the
            modernizing Jew, &#8216;Greek&#8217; became a metaphor for the secular culture
            of modern Europe in its various forms.</p>
          <p>Yaacov Shavit&#8217;s study also provides an illuminating test-case in the
            realm of historical consciousness and the history of ideas. Those interested
            in the growth of secular and national Judaism will find that this wide-ranging
            book makes a significant contribution to an understanding of its development.
            Through discussion of many centuries of Jewish literature, the reader is given
            fresh insight into Jewish culture and shown how its development in the modern
            period has been influenced by the response to other cultures. Those who are
            interested in classical antiquity and Hellenism will welcome this book as a
            unique opportunity to see the worlds of both as Jews perceived them over many
            centuries.</p>

          <p>&lsquo;<em>Yaakov Shavit is a leading Israeli scholar of  intellectual and cultural history. This work expands upon his previous studies  of the ways that modern Jewish and Israeli writers have negotiated foreign and  native elements in their quest to forge a new secular culture . . . The book is  an encyclopedic, if not exhaustive treatment of this subject, which, in its  various permutations, is the subject of modern Jewish thought . . . the  prodigious scope of the book cannot but elicit astonishment and admiration. The  range of subjects and fields of citation . . . give the book the feel of a  magnum opus. In an academic climate in which &ldquo;small is beautiful&rdquo;, Shavit&rsquo;s  book provides a stunning and welcome exception to the trend. It represents a  study of modern Jewish culture encompassing the breadth of intellectual history  characteristic of an earlier age of scholarship.</em>&rsquo; <br />
          Elliott Rabin, <strong>AJS Review</strong></p>
          <p>'<em>Remarkable achievement . . . This is going to be the major work on Jewish Hellenism for a long time to come . . . future scholars may supplement Shavit's narrative, but none will ignore it. It should be in every library and on every syllabus for classes in Jewish studies and the reception of antiquity; and hopefully, it will stimulate dialogue and further study among the various fields of reception and cultural studies, including the history of science . . . a must-read - but be prepared to burn a lot of oil while digesting its rich contents!</em>'   Richard Armstrong, <strong>Classical &amp; Modern Literature</strong></p>
          <p>'<em>Judicious . . . As a historical survey Shavit's book is both timely and
            suggestive. In any debate as central as this, it is crucial to have the historical
            data from which to draw conclusions. . . . Shavit's rich and lively study raises
            fundamental questions and issues that have to be addressed if Jewish and especially
            Israeli society is to make any sense of its heritage in the coming decades.
            The analysis presented here provides crucial material and perspectives that
            others will have to respond to in the years to come.</em>'<br />
            Mordechai Beck, <strong>Jerusalem Post</strong></p>
          <p>'<em>The book's subtitle misleads us into believing that its dominant focus
            will be the Greek roots of modern secular Judaism. In fact, much more can be
            learned about Jewish intellectual history . . . a useful reference book for
            researchers into such diverse fields of interest as Jewish attitudes towards
            sport, the role of archaeology, or the rediscovery of Jewish wisdom literature.</em>' <br />
            Ayala Levin-Kruss, <strong>Jewish Book News &amp; Reviews</strong></p>
          <p> '<em>The greatest concern of secular Judaism is the definition of its function
            in modern life, and Shavit offers us an accurate sense of the difficulties with
            which the freethinking modern Jew was confronted . . . Shavit has undoubtedly
            shown the validity of the &quot;Greek mirror&quot; in reflecting on the historical path
            Judaism has followed over the past centuries.</em>' <br />
            Wout Jac. van Bekkum, <strong>Journal of Jewish Studies</strong></p>

            intellectual history . . . a pluralistic plea against any form of fundamentalism.</em>'<br />
            Dan Diner, <strong>Neue Z&uuml;rcher Zeitung</strong></p>
          <p>'<em>The book itself originally appeared in Hebrew in 1992, but it has been
            considerably revised and modified. It is truly a fascinating and challenging
            study in Jewish intellectural history . . . The author has covered a spectrum
            of a dazzling array of writers and thinkers, and we are most grateful to him
            for seeking to do so sine ira et studio. The work is written in an extremely
            lively and readable style.</em>' <br />

          <p> '<em>Ambitious, elaborately structured and wide-ranging . . . Shavit's book
            will be the fundamental work on Jewish Hellenism for a long time to come . .
            . offers as powerful a case study as one might hope to find on the uses and
            abuses of classical antiquity. He also has much of interest to say on matters
            nearer the margins of his subject. He views history as a continuum, darting
            to and fro in time and taking in the Ancient World itself. Thus he analyses
            in some detail the Jewish-Greek literature of the period, or rather the small
            part of it which survives, teasing out its underlying assumptions. This is a
            worthwhile task . . . It is a curious, and indeed fascinating feature of this
            book that the writing seems at moments to come from within the debate itself.</em>' <br />

        <span class="author">Zeev Gries</span><br />
  </p>
<p>Zeev Gries&rsquo;s analysis of what books were being published and where  shows the importance of the printed book in disseminating religious and secular  ideas, creating a new class of Jewish intellectuals, and making knowledge of  the world available to women. This unique perspective on Jewish intellectual  history in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries through the history of  book-publishing throws light on many of the key Jewish cultural issues of the  time.</p>

          <p>This book offers the reader a voyage in the new world that opened  up to the enlightened Jewish reader of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries,  a time when the first glimmerings of emancipation and secular education were  giving large numbers of Jews their first exposure to science, literature, and  art, and opening their minds to new ideas. And as on any voyage led by a  knowledgeable guide, there are fascinating side-trips along the way: insights  into the world of scholarship, then and now, and into the nature of knowledge.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
All this was happening at a time when  Jews&rsquo; civil status and place in society was undergoing great change in Europe. In this seminal work, Zeev Gries shows that  although the history of the book in the Jewish world has long been regarded as  the province of librarians and bibliophiles, it is in fact the history of the  Jewish intellect. He starts by tracing the awakening of a dormant Jewish intelligentsia&mdash;men,  women, and children who were thirsty for knowledge. Books were the magic kiss  that opened new doors to the modern world; within a century, Jews were making  invaluable contributions to the advancement of science and of culture more generally.  By surveying the literary output of those years, the author is able to discover  what books were being published, where they were published and distributed, and  who was reading them. He surveys the fields of halakhic literature, ethical  literature, kabbalistic and mystical literature, literature for children and  women, and more general literature. He talks about the role of libraries and of  book reviews. Above all, he considers the role of books as agents of culture:  were they guardians of hallowed sanctity or harbingers of secularization?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Gries shows how the types of books favoured by the Jewish reading  public offer an insight into the changing nature of their &lsquo;portable homeland&rsquo;.  He then goes on to discuss the Haskalah movement and the tensions between  increasing secularization and the more traditional world-view, as well as how  the resurrection of Hebrew as a secular literary language contributed to the  awakening of Jewish nationalism. Nevertheless, he argues that the study of  literary history of the period reveals that secular and Zionist leanings were  not the only trends present; Jewish literature continued to be permeated with  the spirit of religion</p>

    Introduction by Joseph Dan
      </p>
<p>Isaiah Tishby, through his study of hitherto unknown manuscripts  and of published works, succeeded in revising the prevalent view of the beliefs  and outlook of Luzzatto and his disciples. Luzzatto is confirmed by this book  as a central figure at the origins of all modern Jewish movements and as one of  the most profound mystics in the history of Jewish culture</p>

        <div class="CollapsiblePanelContent">
          <p>Moses Hayim Luzzatto (1707&ndash;1746), rabbi, mystic, teacher, poet,  playwright, and writer of ethical works, gathered around him in his &lsquo;house of  study&rsquo; in Padua an inner circle of devout Jews who shared his belief in the  imminent arrival of the messianic age and who privately identified members of  their circle as divinely ordained to usher in the Redemption.</p>
          <p>To the rabbis of Venice  and Frankfurt, however, Luzzatto was a  heretic, whose claims to have written works at the dictation of a messenger  from Heaven could not be genuine. Under pressure from them he was obliged to  withdraw a number of such works, and the manuscripts were either lost or destroyed.  Yet his known works came to earn him admiration: as a literary figure among the  adherents of the Enlightenment, as a great kabbalist and profound mystic by  hasidim and even by some of their leading opponents, and as a great ethical  teacher by all religious streams.</p>
          <p>Isaiah Tishby spent many years in the study of Luzzatto and his  group, and succeeded in tracing a number of the lost manuscripts. In essays  translated in this volume he described and annotated the manuscripts which he  found, giving the full text of some of the prose works and of all the poems.  From these manuscripts and Luzzatto&rsquo;s published works, he was able to correct  and add detail to the incomplete picture of Luzzatto and his mystical world  which had been current among scholars. He showed how far the views of earlier  kabbalists and messianists had been accepted or modified by Luzzatto, and found  evidence that he had influenced the early hasidic movement, so lending weight  to Hayim Nahman Bialik&rsquo;s description of Luzzatto as &lsquo;the father and first  begetter&rsquo; of the three main streams of Judaism in modern times. Tishby also  clarified the messianic role for which, as the Padua group believed, certain of their  members were destined under the leadership of Luzzatto.</p>
          <p>One of the most illuminating documents discovered by Tishby and  reproduced here is Luzzatto&rsquo;s version of his ketubah or marriage contract. The phrases of the traditional  contract are interspersed with a mystical commentary in which Luzzatto  identifies himself with the biblical Moses and interprets his earthly marriage  as a marriage with the Shekhinah, the Divine Presence or female element of the  Godhead. Thus she would be rescued from exile among the forces of evil and the  way would be cleared for the final redemption.</p>
          <p>A second key document  is the personal, mystical diary which Luzzatto&rsquo;s second-in-command, Rabbi Moses  David Valle, wrote in the margins of his own voluminous commentary on the  Bible. The commentary itself, written in impersonal terms, yields  autobiographical information, but the diary entries, in short and often  enigmatic notes, record the personal mystical visions and experiences,  encouragements and disappointments, of the man who saw himself and was seen in  Luzzatto&rsquo;s group as the Messiah ben David. </p>

          <h3>Reviews</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="CollapsiblePanelContent">'Isaiah Tishby's  contribution to the study of Luzzatto, both in terms of manuscript work as well  as critical analysis, is of seminal importance, and the translations of his Hebrew  studies of Luzzatto that appear in this volume are an invaluable asset to  English readers . . . Taken together the texts and studies contained in this  volume provide a rich resource for considering the at times ironic and often  secret role that mysticial and messianic discourse plays in Jewish religious,  intellectual, and cultural history . . . <em>Messianic Mysticism</em> is at  present the largest single resource for the study of Luzzatto in English.'  <br />

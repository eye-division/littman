        <span class="booksubtitle">Jews in Kraków</span><br />
        <span class="author">Edited by Michal Galas &amp; Antony Polonsky</span>      </p>
    <p>Kraków―one of the great centres of Jewish culture in  east-central Europe―has always had a special place in the hearts of its Jewish  inhabitants, much more so than was ever the case elsewhere in Poland.  Considering Jewish life in the city from a wide range of social and cultural  perspectives, primarily in the last two centuries, the contributors to this  volume present a fascinating detailed panorama to explain why this should have  been the case.</p>

        <p>Few Polish cities have evoked more affection among their  Jewish inhabitants than Kraków, and this volume brings together the work of  leading historians from Israel, Poland, and the United States to explore how  this relationship evolved. It takes as its starting point 1772, when Poland was  partitioned between the Great Powers and Kraków came under Austrian rule, and  examines the relationship between the Jewish minority and the Polish majority  in the city in the different stages of its history down to the period of German  occupation in the Second World War. An additional perspective is provided by a  consideration of how Jewish life in Kraków has been remembered by Holocaust  survivors, and how it is portrayed in post-war Polish literature.</p>
        <p>The main explanation for the specific nature of relations  between Poles and Jews in Kraków as it emerges from these studies seems to be  that Jewish acculturation to Polish culture was more pronounced in Kraków than  anywhere else in Poland. The Jewish community as a whole opened itself up to  contemporary currents and participated in the life of the city, above all in  its cultural dimension, while nevertheless retaining a highly articulated sense  of Jewish identity and unity. This meant that they were able both to defend  their interests effectively and to establish links with the rest of the  population from a position of strength. An additional important factor appears  to have been the more tolerant atmosphere which prevailed in the  Austro-Hungarian empire, which meant that ethnic tensions were less acute than  elsewhere on the Polish lands. Furthermore, the fact that the city was largely  pre-industrial and conservative, and was a spiritual and intellectual centre  for both Catholics and Jews, may paradoxically have mitigated ethnic conflict,  as did the fact that the two societies—Polish and Jewish—were largely socially  separate. While the increase in antisemitism after 1935 and the consequences of  the Holocaust are still etched in the minds of many, the city nevertheless has  a special place in Jewish hearts and will continue to be remembered as one of  the great centres of Jewish culture in east-central Europe.</p>
        <p>          As in other volumes of Polin, the New Views section  examines a number of important topics. These include a general investigation of  the situation of the Jews in Galicia; an analysis of the position of Jewish  slave labourers in the Kielce area under Nazi rule; an investigation into the  resurgence after 1944 of the myth of ritual murder; and a discussion of the  history of the Jewish settlement in Lower Silesia after the Second World War.</p>

            dimensions.</em>' <br />
            Mark Mazower, <strong>Jewish Book News &amp; Reviews</strong></p>
          <p>The latter part of the thirteenth century is regarded as a key period in the
            history of Italian Jewry. During that time many Jewish communities sprang up
            in the regions of central and northern Italy. Their appearance marked a turning-point
            in the history of Jews in the Italian peninsula as the Jewish presence had previously
            been focused on Rome and the south.</p>
          <p>In this much-acclaimed study, originally published in Italian, Ariel Toaff
            captures all the intricacies of everyday life in the medieval Jewish communities
            of Umbria. A thorough examination of Hebrew and Italian archival sources enables
            him to characterize in detail the defining features of Jewish life in the region
            at that time and to show clearly how the common stereotype of a single, undifferentiated
            Jewish community does not reflect the reality. Instead, he presents a picture
            of a complex society that&#8212;far from being a &#8216;mere&#8217; minority
            and somewhat isolated&#8212;actually contributed greatly to contemporary society
            and played a significant role in shaping it, while at the same time also being
            influenced by the surrounding Christian society.</p>
          <p>Professor Toaff elaborates contemporary Jewish traditions and practices associated
            with love, marriage, food, work, sickness, and death in the context of everyday
            social relations between Christians and Jews. In so doing he presents a full
            and fascinating reconstruction of the Jewish life of the period that faithfully
            reflects the links and divides between the two communities.</p>
          <p>Engagingly written, <em>Love, Work, and Death: Jewish Life in Medieval Umbria</em> will be of interest to the general reader, while its detailed references to
            archival documentation make it a particularly valuable source for students of
            medieval Jewish history and specialists in the social history of medieval and
            Renaissance Italy.</p>

          <p>'<em>Fascinating and erudite . . . The fruit of detailed and extensive research,
  it succeeds in combining scholarly rigour with vivid readability: the result
  is a compelling picture of daily life in all its dimensions. . . . Toaff's sympathetic
  study, by setting the Umbrian Jews of an earlier period in the appropriate social
  context, allows us to view the more tolerant and complex world which existed
  . . . There is, perhaps, a lesson here for the Jewish historiography of our
  own time too.</em>' <br />
Mark Mazower, <strong>Jewish Book News &amp; Reviews</strong></p>
          <p> '<em>A very thoroughly documented and most readable presentation . . . The
            Jews of Umbria and Love, Work, and Death constitute two very important and complementary
            contributions to the reconstruction of a significant and interesting chapter
            in the history of Jewish life in the pre-modern Diaspora by a scholar thoroughly
            at home in the relevant languages, literatures, and methodologies. Moreover,
            the English translation of Love, Work, and Death further opens up the history
            of the Jews of the Italian peninsula to the reader without Italian. Finally,
            while most welcome for its own sake, in a wider context, Professor Toaff's work
            marks an important contribution to the comparative analysis of different Jewish
            societies over the ages.</em>' <br />
            Benjamin Ravid, <strong>Jewish Quarterly Review</strong></p>
          <p> '<em>Professor Toaff is the acknowledged master of the social history of Umbrian
            Jewry. . . . It is to be hoped that the new ideas interspersed in Toaff's presentation
            will stimulate further research and yield fresh perspectives on medieval Jewish
            society and culture.</em>' <br />
            David Malkiel, <strong>Journal of Jewish Studies </strong></p>
          <p>'<em>The book has much improved in its English translation: including an index
            (mandatory item) and a rich bibliography, both lacking in the original edition
            . . . Toaff is well versed in both Latin and Hebrew sources, and is able to
            present an impressive picture of the Jewish minority.</em>' <br />

Shubert Spero, <strong>Studies in Contemporary Jewry</strong></p>
          <p>Leon Roth (1896&#8211;1963) was the first Professor of Philosophy at the Hebrew
            University of Jerusalem. He saw it as his purpose to encourage his students
            to think, and to think about their Judaism. Typical of his approach is the question
            with which this selection of essays opens: in what sense, asks Roth, can we
            talk about Jewish philosophy, and what can we expect to find if we look for
            it?</p>
          <p>Defining philosophy as &#8216;the search, through thought, for the permanent&#8217;,
            Roth argues that in order to say whether there is a truly Jewish philosophy
            one has to &#8216;rethink fundamentals&#8217;&#8212;those elements in our lives,
            in history, in nature which appear to be not incidental and trivial but basic.
            The twelve elegantly written essays published here represent a selection of
            Roth&#8217;s explorations of various aspects of his theme.</p>
          <p>The title essay ends with the contention that Judaism must be seen as the classic
            expression of monotheism; as the antithesis of myth; and as the essence of ethics
            and morality. The emphasis that Roth placed on ethics as the essence of Judaism
            was not merely theoretical: in 1951 he resigned from the Hebrew University and
            left Israel in response to what he perceived as the betrayal of Jewish ethics
            by the rulers of the newly established State of Israel.</p>
          <p>Edward Ullendorff's Foreword, based on long years of personal acquaintance,
            is an appreciation of Roth&#8217;s singular personality, grace, and moral stature,
            and of his devotion to an interpretation of Judaism that is rational and humane.</p>
          <p>A complete bibliography of Roth's writings, compiled by Raphael Loewe, rounds
            out the picture of the man and his achievements.</p>

<h3>About the author</h3>
      <p>Following a brilliant academic career in England, <strong>Leon Roth </strong>(1896-1963)
        became, at the age of 32, the first professor of philosophy at the Hebrew
        University of Jerusalem. In 1944, at the age of 44, he became its youngest
        rector. Like Maimonides and Spinoza - both of whom he admired and wrote
        about - Roth was concerned with the relationships between the Jewish religion
        and contemporary philosophical ideas. He was a practical philosopher,
        and was particularly interested in the application of Jewish ethical principles
    to the problems of his time. </p>
      <p>Roth's ideal of Judaism as a way of life came into sharp conflict with
        developments in Palestine after the establishment of the State of Israel.
        He was particularly troubled by the wanton killing of civilians and by
        the treatment of refugees following the fighting in 1947-8. In 1953 he
        resigned his Chair and returned to England. In the remaining ten years
        of his life he travelled and lectured widely, and wrote most of the essays
        included in this volume. He died suddenly at the conclusion of a tour
        of New Zealand, just after his sixty-seventh birthday.    </p>

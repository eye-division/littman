        <p><span class="booksubtitle">Creating a Tradition of Learning</span><br />
       <span class="author">Shaul Stampfer<br />
       </span><span class="translator">Translated from Hebrew by Lindsey Taylor-Guthartz</span>      </p>
    <p>This is the first systematic study of the Lithuanian yeshivas that  flourished from 1802 to 1914 in their social and cultural context; their legacy  still dominates orthodox Jewish society. The main focus is the yeshiva of Volozhin,  which in its independence of the local community was the model for everything  that followed, but chapters are also devoted to the yeshivas of Slobodka and  Telz, and to the kollel system.</p>

          <p>One of the key ways in which the traditional Jewish world of  eastern Europe responded to the challenges of modernity in the nineteenth  century was to change the system for educating young men so as to reinforce  time-honoured, conservative values. The yeshivas established at that time in Lithuania  became models for an educational system that has persisted to this day,  transmitting the talmudic underpinnings of the traditional Jewish way of life.  To understand how that system works, one needs to go back to the institutions  they are patterned on: why they were established, how they were organized, and  how they operated.<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
            This is the first properly documented, systematic study of the  Lithuanian yeshiva as it existed from 1802-1914. It is based on the judicious  use of contemporary sources&mdash;documents, articles in the press, and memoirs&mdash;with  a view to presenting the yeshiva in its social and cultural context. Three key  institutions are considered. Pride of place in the first part of the book is  given to the yeshiva of Volozhin, which was founded in 1802 according to an  entirely new concept&mdash;total independence from the local community&mdash;and was in  that sense the model for everything that followed. Chapters in the second part  focus on the yeshiva of Slobodka, famed for introducing the study of musar (ethics); the yeshiva of Telz,  with its structural and organizational innovations; and the kollel system,  introduced so that married men could continue their yeshiva education. Topics  covered include the leadership and changes in leadership; management and  administration; the yeshiva as a place of study; daily life, and so forth.<br />
          </p>
          <p>This edition is based  on the second Hebrew edition, which was revised so as to include information  that became available with the opening up of archives in eastern Europe after  the fall of communism.</p>

          <p><em>'Stampfer sifts through mountains of documentation, searching  for versions that ring true and painting an extraordinarily detailed account of  every aspect of life in the famous yeshivot. His book is vital to the students  of Orthodox Jewish history and of Jewish culture in eastern Europe.'</em><br />
          Pinchas Roth, <strong>Association of Jewish Libraries Reviews</strong></p>
<p><em>'One of the foremost experts on eastern European Jewry . . . He has a well-deserved reputation for being one of the nicest people in Israeli academia; but he seems to revel in challenging common assumptions, tweaking conventional wisdom, and making eastern European Jewry look very different from what everyone seems to think. He does all of these things in [this book], an expanded translation of his masterful 1995 Hebrew book on the subject. Its publication should change the way English-speaking Jews think about what a yeshiva is and ought to be.' </em><br />
            Yoel Finkelman, <strong>Jewish Ideas Daily</strong></p>
<p><em>‘[The English version] is a book incorporating the latest research by Stampfer, which would be most useful and effective when read along with the author's collection Families, Rabbis, and Education . . . Together, these two studies provide an in-depth analysis of the role of educational institutions for the traditional community undergoing a process of modernization their actual and projected impact on members of the community, and their socio-cultural environment . . . undoubtedly an important tool for the researcher of the Jewish history and culture of Eastern Europe, and its appearance in the English language significantly broadens its audience.’</em> <br />
Lara Lempertienė, <strong>Lithuanian Historical Studies</strong></p>
<p><em>‘A serious work of exhaustive scholarship.’   </em><br />

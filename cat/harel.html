          <p>This pioneering study offers a  comprehensive account of Syria's key Jewish communities at an  important juncture in their history that also throws light on the broader  effects of modernization in the Ottoman empire.</p>
          <p>The Ottoman  reforms of the mid-nineteenth century accelerated the process of opening  up Syria up to European travellers and traders, and gave Syria's  Jews access to European Jewish communities. The resulting influx  of Western ideas led to a decline in the traditional economy,  with serious consequences for the Jewish occupational structure. It  also allowed for the introduction of Western education, through  schools run by the Alliance Isra&eacute;lite Universelle, influenced the  structure and the administration of Jewish society in Syria, and changed  the balance of the relationship between Muslims, Christians, and  Jews. Initially Syria's Jewish communities flourished economically  and politically in these new circumstances, but there was  a developing recognition that their future lay overseas. After the  opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, the bankruptcy of the Ottoman  empire in 1875, and the suspension of the Ottoman constitution in 1878,  this feeling intensified. A process of decline set in  that ultimately culminated in large-scale Jewish  emigration, first to Egypt and then to the West. From that point on, the  future for Syrian Jews lay in the West, not the East.</p>
          <p>Detailed and  compelling, this book covers Jewish community life, the legal status  of Jews in Syria, their relationship with their Muslim and Christian  neighbours, and their links with the West. It draws on a wide range  of archival material in six languages, including Jewish, Christian  Arab, and Muslim Arab sources, Ottoman and European documents, consular  reports, travel accounts, and reports from the contemporary press and by  emissaries to Syria of the Alliance Isra&eacute;lite Universelle.  Rabbinic sources, including the archive of the chief rabbinate  in Istanbul, are particularly important in opening a window  onto Syrian Jewish life and concerns. Together these sources bring to  light an enormous amount of material and provide a broad, multifaceted  perspective on the Syrian Jewish community.</p>
          <p><em>'A work of  impressive scholarship, offering new insights into and understanding  of the impact of Ottoman reforms on the restructuring of the Syrian Jewish  community. The anecdotal material is fascinating and the questioning  of old stereotypes is important. It is not a study that will be  easily surpassed: it represents many years of serious scholarship and the  ability to challenge some old views with new data. It is definitely a book  that anyone teaching Middle Eastern Jewry should read and assign to  students. Descendants of that community in America should welcome its  insights into their history and culture.'  </em> <br />
            Jane Gerber</p>
          <p>The Hebrew edition of the book was the winner of the  Ben Zvi Award for Research in Oriental Jewry in 2004. <br />
            <em>‘For the first time in the historiography of the Jews  of Muslim countries we are presented with a rich picture, well written and  riveting, of the history of important Jewish communities in the period of the  Tanzimat.’ </em><br />

        <p><em>&lsquo;A very well-researched and  comprehensive survey of one of the lesser-known Jewish Middle Eastern  communities.&rsquo; </em><br />
Rachel Simon, <strong>AJL Newsletter</strong></p>
        <p><em>'Yaron Harel's exceptionally rich and  rewarding book marks a major milestone in our understanding of the history of  Jews in the Arab lands and, more generally, the changing position of Ottoman  religious minorities during the Tanzimat era. No other account of Jewish life  in the Ottoman Empire of which I am aware combines archival depth and attention  to detail with conceptual breadth and a willingness to challenge existing  assumptions in quite this way. Studies tracing the history of individual Jewish  communities and their confrontation with modernity have now been in vogue for a  generation. This is a classic in the genre . . . this is a work of consummate  scholarship and subtle insight. Those with a specialist interest in such  phenomena will find it a veritable treasure trove. It will undoubtedly be  required reading for anyone interested in the history of the Jews in Muslim  lands and for scholars working on the Tanzimat era. Bt it deserves to find a  wider readership than this. For such a richly documented account of the  evolution of Syrian Jewry on the threshold of modernity serves as a useful  counterpoint for scholars interested in the transformation, emancipation, and  acculturation of Jewish communities in other sears of the world.' </em><br />
        Abigail  Green, <strong>English Historical Review</strong></p>
        <p><em>'A brilliant study of the history of the Jewish communities of Damascus and Aleppo during the nineteenth century. This is a formidable task and Harel admirably rises to the challenge of telling the story . . . employs an impressive array of European and Jewish archival sources from the various rabbinates, as well as records of Jewish organizations such as the Alliance Israélite Universelle, many for the first time . . . a must read for students and academics as well as those more generally interested in the history of the Jewish communities of Syria in modern times.'   </em><br />
        Josef Meri, <strong>Journal of Modern Jewish Studies</strong></p>
        <p><em>'Extremely well researched and detailed and  will be an invaluable resource for those interested in Syrian Jewry, late  Ottoman Syria, and Middle Eastern history more generally.'</em><br />
        Ari Ariel, <strong>Syrian  Studies Association Newsletter</strong></p>
<p><strong>From Reviews of the Hebrew Edition</strong></p>
        <p><em>'A work to be appreciated not only on its own merits, but  also as an example of the kind of research that the Jews of the  nineteenth-century Middle East deserve . . . I am impressed by the solid base  of primary historical sources in which the research is grounded, as well as by  the thoroughness and scope of this professional and serious work, which fills  the lacuna that existed until now in modern Jewish historical scholarship.' </em><br />

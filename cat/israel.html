          <p><em>'Continues to be a basic book for understanding how Jews were affected by
  the changes of the early modern period.'</em> <br />
Stephen J. Burnett, <strong>Sixteenth Century Journal </strong></p>
          <p>This survey history of Jewish life and culture in early modern Europe is the
            first to focus on the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries as a radically new
            phase in Jewish history. The book lays particular emphasis on the reversal of
            trends in western and central Europe in the late sixteenth century, which was
            followed by a rapid increase in Jewish numbers and activity, and far-reaching
            reorganization of Jewish society and institutions. A major consequence of these
            changes was a much expanded and more varied Jewish role in European civilization
            as a whole. </p>
          <p>The first edition of this book was the joint winner of the Wolfson Literary
            Prize for History in 1986. For this third edition, the book has been updated

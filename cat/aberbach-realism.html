          <p>'<em>There is much in this book on Mendele's confused psychological state of
            mind . . . will do much to take readers beyond the stereotypical image of Mendele
            as the amusing satirist of shtetl mores and provoke interest in him as a key
            figure in modern Jewish literature.</em>' <br />
            Barry Davis, <strong>Jewish Book News &amp; Reviews</strong></p>
          <p>Mendele Mocher Sefarim&#8217;s seven novels constitute the most important and
            influential body of work in modern Jewish prose fiction written prior to the
            First World War. These novels&#8212;five of which he wrote twice, once in Yiddish
            and once in Hebrew&#8212;are devastating satiric portraits of Jewish life in
            nineteenth-century Russia. They are permeated by Mendele&#8217;s passion for
            social change, and an often equally passionate contempt for his own people for
            failing to achieve it.</p>
          <p>David Aberbach, exploring these passions in terms of the psychology of prejudice
            and self-hate, provides the first full-length analysis of the tension between
            realism and caricature in Mendele&#8217;s descriptions of his fellow-Jew. At
            the same time, his analysis conveys Mendele&#8217;s fascinating social and psychological
            insights into the forces which led to the mass emigration of Jews from Russia
            before the First World War, to the rise of Zionism, and to Jewish involvement
            in the socialist and revolutionary movements in Russia at the turn of the century.
            The picture is broadened through references to contemporary Russian literature
            so as to portray these forces in the context of Russian society at the time.</p>
          <p>Aberbach&#8217;s skilful presentation allows the reader to gain access to Mendele&#8217;s
            works through many tantalizing excerpts, with some of the key passages provided
            in Hebrew and Yiddish as well as in Aberbach&#8217;s lively translation. He
            also makes available the considerable body of Mendele scholarship that has been
            published in Hebrew in recent years.</p>
          <p>From this fascinating and lucid work, scholars and general readers alike will
            gain a new understanding not only of the social realities of Jewish life in
            tsarist Russia but also of how the self-image of an ethnic minority may be affected
            and even determined by the character and social problems of the majority culture.</p>

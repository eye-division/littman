	<p>A cogent analysis of the development in orthodoxy that is often described as 'the swing to the Right', a rupture with pre-existing attitudes and patterns of behaviour that has had major consequences not only for Jewish society but also for the nature of Jewish spirituality. The consequent enshrinement of texts as the sole source of authenticity is explored in depth, along with its implications for religious performance, religious education, and the scope of religion in the political arena.</p>

	    <p>The  essay that forms the core of this book is an attempt to understand  the developments in orthodox  Jewry  that have occurred over the past half-century  and their implications. The prime change is what is often described  as 'the swing to the Right',  a rupture with pre-existing attitudes and patterns of behaviour that  has had major consequences not only for Jewish society but also for  Jewish spirituality. For Haym Soloveitchik the root of this change  lies in the migration from eastern Europe to the New World. The move  from a corporate state to a democratic one, and from a deeply ethnic  milieu to an open society, meant a shift from a self-contained world  to one where ways of thinking and acting were moulded by new  influences. In multicultural America and other centres of migration,  far from the largely self-contained Jewish environment of eastern  Europe, religious practice could no longer be transmitted mimetically  by home and street  as it had been for centuries. Acculturation  to American society diluted the role of the family in transmitting  religion, compromised its authenticity, and, finally, delegitimized  it. In a world where only  the  sacred texts were regarded as authentic, religious life had to be  reconstructed anew from them and from them alone. Traditional conduct  thus lost its prescriptive force, and behaviour once governed by  habit  was now  governed by rule. However, religion as inscribed and religion as  received, as handed down over the long arc of generations, are  scarcely identical. As religion increasingly came  to be conducted  by the book, the older generation—practitioners of the  centuries-old, mimetic religiosity—discovered  that their parents'  teachings  were  now  for naught and that the  habits  of a lifetime no longer  met the  new standards.</p>
	    <p>This  dramatic increase in the power of the  written  word and its new role as the touchstone of religious authenticity has  had far-reaching  effects which are explored here in depth. Not only has it altered the  very nature of religious performance, it has also transformed the  character and purpose of religious education, redistributed political  power within the religious world, and defined anew the scope of  religion in the political arena.</p>
	    <p> Long  established as a classic in the field, the publication of this  seminal essay in book form allows the author to deal with criticisms  raised since it was originally published, enabling readers to gain a  broader perspective  on a topic central to today's Jewish world and its  future development.</p>

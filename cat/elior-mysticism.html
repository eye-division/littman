        Translated from Hebrew by Yudith Nave and Arthur Millman
      </p>
<p>The corpus of Jewish mystical writings has developed over thousands of years in different parts of the world. Its creators sought to discover hidden realms that would shed light on existing reality. The literature they created, one of the central sources of inspiration of religious thought, comprises hundreds of volumes. This masterly investigation of the Jewish mystical phenomenon, from antiquity to the twentieth century, contextualizes it in the spiritual and historical circumstances in which it evolved.</p>

        <div class="CollapsiblePanelContent">
          <p>Mysticism, which transcends the boundaries of time and space and  refers to a reality not grasped by means of ordinary human cognition, is one of  the central sources of inspiration of religious thought. It is an attempt to  decode the mystery of divine existence by penetrating to the depths of  consciousness through language, memory, myth, and symbolism. Delving deep into  the psyche, mystics strive to redeem perceived reality from its immediate  meaning.</p>
          <p>Mystical texts constitute a history of  this religious creativity, of man&rsquo;s attempt to reveal the divine structure  underlying the chaos of reality and thereby endow life with hope and purpose.  By offering an alternative perspective on the world that gives expression to  yearnings for freedom and change, mysticism engenders new modes of authority  and leadership; as such it plays a decisive role in moulding religious and  social history. For all these reasons, the mystical corpus deserves study and  discussion in the framework of cultural criticism and research. <br />
  &nbsp;<br />
            This study is a lyrical exposition of the  Jewish mystical phenomenon. It is based on a close reading of the hundreds of  volumes written by Jewish mystics and incorporates mystical testimonies drawn  from the different countries and cultural environments in which Jews have  lived. Rachel Elior&rsquo;s purpose is to present, as accurately as possible, the  meanings of the mystical works as they were perceived by their creators and  readers. At the same time, she contextualizes them within the boundaries of the  religion, culture, language, and spiritual and historical circumstances in  which the destiny of the Jewish people has evolved.. </p>
          <p>The author succeeds in drawing the reader into a mystical world.  With great intensity, she conveys the richness of the mystical experience in  discovering the infinity of meaning embedded in the sacred text; teasing out  the recurring themes, she explains the multivalent symbols. Using copious  extracts from Jewish mystical sources, she illustrates the varieties of the  mystical experience from antiquity to the twentieth century. She succeeds in  eloquently conveying how mystics try to decipher reality by penetrating beyond  its apparent boundaries: how they experience spiritual powers symbolically,  imaginatively, or visually; how hidden truths are revealed in visions or  dreams, in an epiphany or as &lsquo;lightning&rsquo;; how they are &lsquo;engraved&rsquo; in the mind  or illuminate in the soul. Most of the texts she draws on are written in very  obscure language, but the skilful translations communicate the mystical  experiences vividly and make it easy for the reader to understand how Elior  uses them to explain the relationship between the revealed world and the hidden  world and between the mystical world and the traditional religious world, with  all the social and religious tensions this has caused. </p>

          <p>Hyam Maccoby's now classic study, originally published in 1982, focuses on
            the major Jewish-Christian disputations of medieval Europe: those of Paris (1240),
            Barcelona (1263), and Tortosa (1413-14). It examines the content of these theological
            confrontations with a sense of present-day relevance, while also discussing
            the use made of scriptural proof-texts. Part I provides a general thematic consideration
            of the three disputations and their social and historical background. Part II
            is a complete translation of the account of the Barcelona Disputation written
            by Nahmanides, one of the greatest figures in the history of Jewish learning,
            who was Jewish spokesman at the disputation. Part III contains Jewish and Christian
            accounts of the Paris and Tortosa disputations.</p>
          <p>A new introduction reviews the relevant literature that has been published
            since the original edition appeared.</p>

            blended this learning with an exposition of the issues involved that is accessible

    <h1>The Mystical Origins of Hasidism</h1>
    <p><span class="author">Rachel Elior</span></p>
      <p>This very accessible introduction to hasidism as a movement opens a new window on its mystical underpinnings. It discusses the origins and dissemination of hasidism and the literature that facilitated this; the theological basis of hasidism and the mystical significance of the tsadik; the major figures of hasidism; and the complex links to kabbalah and Shabbateanism. The discussion of the intellectual and social implications highlights the eighteenth century as a key period in modern Jewish history.</p>

          <p>The words 'hasid' and 'hasidism' have become so familiar to people interested in the Jewish world that little thought is given to understanding exactly what hasidism is or considering its spiritual and social consequences.</p>
          <p>What, for example, are the distinguishing features of hasidism? What innovations does it embody? How did its founders see it? Why did it arouse opposition? What is the essential nature of hasidic thought? What is its spiritual essence? What does its literature consist of? What typifies its leadership? What is the secret of its persistence through the centuries? How have scholars explained its origins? Is hasidism an expression of mystical ideas, or a response to changing social circumstances? What is its connection to kabbalah? To Shabateanism? To messianism? What is its relationship to the traditional structures of authority in the Jewish world? This book aims to answer all these questions in a lucid and accessible manner.</p>
          <p>Rachel Elior focuses on the fundamental positions and the factors of primary importance: the substantial issues that recur in the hasidic texts, including how hasidim have seen themselves over the centuries, how they have constructed a new spiritual and social ideal, and how that ideal has stood the test of reality. The goal is to present the main characteristics of the hasidic movement and to examine the social implications of its mystical ideas. The text is fully supported by references to the relevant hasidic sources and academic literature. The book concludes with a list of the hasidic texts on which the discussion is based and a comprehensive bibliography of scholarly works on kabbalah and hasidism.</p>

          <p><em>'Well written and concise and, together with her glossary, provides a good grounding for the educated reader beginning a study of hasidic texts . . . I recommend this book for all academic libraries.'</em><br />
            Daniel J. Rettberg, <strong>Association of Jewish Libraries Newsletter</strong></p>
          <p><span color:purple="color:purple"'>'<em>Such a survey of basic questions presented in a concise and  lucid form, on a scholarly basis but written for a general readership was a  desideratum. Not many monographic introductions to hasidism have appeared,  although the Littman Library of Jewish Civilization has recently published  several important books on the subject . . . highly commendable book . . .  there is much to be learned from it about hasidism.</em>' &nbsp; <br />
            Annelies Kuyt, <strong>European  Journal of Jewish Studies</strong></span></p>
          <p><em>'Succinct and lucid . . . Elior is particularly  interested in hasidism’s originator, R. Israel ben Eliezer (the Ba’al Shem  Tov). Unlike other scholars of the Ba’al Shem Tov, however, who focus on his  career as a mystical practitioner (ba’al shem), Elior grapples with his  innovative theology. She then expands her study to subsequent generations of  hasidic leaders . . . accessible . . . a singular contribution.'</em><br />
          Glenn Dynner, <strong>H-Judaic</strong></p>
<p>'<em>An impressive  scholarly work which eloquently paints a beautiful picture of Hasidism's  emergence and fate.</em>' &nbsp; <br />

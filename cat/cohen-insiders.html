<p>This collection of essays breaks new ground in its interdisciplinary  study of the way Jews redefined their identity in the changing societies of  modern eastern Europe. Sensitively treating the drama of east European Jewry  from cultural and political vantage points, prominent scholars provide fresh  insights into the complex issues facing the Jewish world. The multifaceted  essays in this volume reflect the influence of the pioneering work of the  historian Ezra Mendelsohn.      </p>

          <p><em>Insiders and Outsiders:  Dilemmas of East European Jewry</em> examines problems  of Jewish cultural and political orientations, associations, and  self-identification within a broad framework. The contributors approach the  predicament of east European Jews in various settings: some focus primarily on  the Jews' inner development and outlook, while others discuss how elements of  the majority society viewed their presence. Scholars of history, art history,  and literature display originality and insight in illuminating the nuances and  intricacies of the Jewish &lsquo;outsider&rsquo;.</p>
          <p>Following an overview by the  distinguished intellectual historian of German Jewry Steven Aschheim, who  offers some comprehensive thoughts on the insider/outsider dilemma in modern  times and its relevance to eastern Europe, the discussion evolves around three  major themes: the cultural conundrum; modes of acculturation, assimilation, and  identity; and the minority&rsquo;s inclusion in or exclusion from the political  agendas of certain east European societies. It concludes with a focus on two  remarkable cities&#8213;Czernowitz and Vilnius&#8213;where the Jewish minority has often been  conceived as being no less &lsquo;inside&rsquo; than other groups. </p>
          <p>Contributors to the &lsquo;cultural  conundrum&rsquo; section deal with artists and writers from Romania and Poland who  have gained wide public and critical attention over the years, including Reuven  Rubin, Itzik Manger, Avot Yeshurun, and Mihail Sebastian. Other essays discuss  the work of a group of writers from Poland, including Henryk Grynberg, Wilhelm  Dichter, Joanna Olczak-Ronikier, Krzysztof Teodor Toeplitz, and Michal  Glowinski, who reflected intensively on their experiences as Jews in the Second  World War and tried to integrate these experiences into their often fractured  identities. The complex personal evolution of these figures shows the  multi-layered influences on their creativity and imagination, while  underscoring the dilemmas they faced to find points of meeting between their  Jewish background and their national identity.</p>
          <p>The section on modes of  acculturation, assimilation, and identity offers detailed analyses of the ways  in which multi-ethnic and multi-national situations demand that the &lsquo;outsider&rsquo;,  consciously or unconsciously, develop inner strategies to fashion a specific  identity. Surveying such vibrant areas as Czechoslovakia and Poland between the  two world wars and the city of Lw&oacute;w in the late nineteenth century, three  essays present some of the choices Jews made in order to deal with the changing  political and cultural context. Their meditations on&nbsp; belonging and not-belonging&#8213;on the  constitution of identity and its fluidity, and on the formation, breakdown, and  reconfiguration of physical, mental, social, and geographical borders&#8213;acquire a  special relevance and urgency in these settings. </p>
          <p>How did Jews as &lsquo;outsiders&rsquo;  configure their political allegiance in eastern Europe? How prominent were they  in the radical elements of the communist movement in Russia? What tactics did  they employ to safeguard their future in such societies and what means did they  employ to galvanize the &lsquo;Jewish street&rsquo;? These are some of the questions raised  in the section on society and politics, which delves into such problematic  terrain as &lsquo;Jewish informers&rsquo;, the &lsquo;non-Jewish Jew&rsquo;, and &lsquo;Jewish politics&rsquo;.</p>
The concluding essays  examine the tensions, paradoxes, and ironies of the phenomenon of the Jewish  outsider in Czernowitz and Vilnius, two cities where, indeed, Jews were often  construed to be the true &lsquo;insiders&rsquo;. </div>

      <p><em>'This volume, thanks to the high quality and diversity of its offerings, is clearly a major contribution to east European Jewish studies and to the larger fields of Jewish history and cultural studies.'</em><br />
Natan Meir, <strong>H-Judaic</strong></p>
      <p><em>'Intellectual provocations and  controversial and new interpretations are very important, especially if they  come together with solid scholarship. This is the case of the book under  review, which is a must read for everybody interested in the assimilation of  east European Jews.'</em><br />
        Piotr Wróbel, <strong>H-Judaic</strong></p>
      <p><em>'All authors present well-grounded conclusions with regard to the specific problems they analyse and suggest that by using a methodological approach like that of &quot;outsiders&quot; and &quot;insiders&quot; it is possible to widen the scope of research on identity change and provide a fresh look at conflcts possibly based on individual choices, their contexts, and consequences. Thus, the articles in this book, each in their way, convincingly prove the viability and multi-functionality of this methodological apprach in research on modern east European Jewish culture and history.'   </em><br />

    <p>The  influence of Rashi’s commentaries on the Bible and the Talmud on  Jewish thinking remains unsurpassed, This biographical study presents  a masterly survey of the social and cultural background of Rashi’s  work, his personality, his reputation, and his influence, while also  considering his sources, his interpretative method, his innovations,  and his style and language. The central contribution, however, is the  in-depth analysis of Rashi’s world-view, which leads to conclusions  that are likely to stimulate much debate.</p>

        <p>To  this day, the commentaries on the Bible and Talmud written by the  eleventh-century scholar known as Rashi remain unsurpassed. His  influence on Jewish thinking was, and still is, significant. His  commentary on the Pentateuch was the first Hebrew book to be printed,  giving rise to hundreds of supercommentaries. Christian scholars,  too, have relied heavily on his explanations of biblical texts. </p>
        <p>In  this volume Avraham Grossman presents a masterly survey of the social  and cultural background to Rashi’swork  and pulls together the strands of information available on his life,  his personality, his reputation during his lifetime, and his  influence as a teacher. He discusses each of his main commentaries in  turn, including such aspects as his sources, his interpretative  method, his innovations, and his style and language. Attention is  also given to his halakhic monographs, responsa, and liturgical  poems.        </p>
<p>Despite  Rashi’s importance as a scholar and the vast literature published  about him, two central questions remain essentially unanswered: what  was Rashi’s world-view, and was he a conservative or a  revolutionary? Professor Grossman considers these points at length,  and his in-depth analysis of Rashi’s world-view—particularly his  understanding of Jewish uniqueness, Jewish values, and Jewish  society—leads to conclusions that are likely to stimulate much  debate.</p>

        <p><em>'Grossman draws heavily from the current Israeli scholarship on Rashi, including his own scholarly works, to present a well-rounded picture of Rashi. It is a work of synthesis; explicating clearly more arcane studies. Gross is a very good teacher, making his arguments clearly and using examples which clarify his own even further. He is especially helpful to explain Rashi's relationship with the midrashic literature whether in the commentary of the Torah or elsewhere. Recommended for libraries with comprehensive undergraduate programmes and any synagogue library.'   </em><br />
          Roger S. Kohn, <strong>Association for Jewish Libraries Reviews</strong></p>
          <p><em>‘The leading authority of his generation in this field.’</em><br />Marc Saperstein, <strong>European Judaism</strong></p>
        <p><em>'Avraham Grossman, one of the world's foremost scholars of  medieval Judaica . . . reads some famous texts very closely in an attempt to  make Rashi come to life for twenty-first century readers . . . a tour de force  . . . Grossman's book, just like the works of Rashi, can be read with profit  and enjoyment by both scholars and amateurs.'</em><br />
        Martin Lockshin, <strong>H-Judaic</strong></p>
        <p><em>'Arguably the most learned scholar today writing about the life and works of Rashi . . admirable book . . . the scholarly achievements of Avraham Grossman, to which this book attests on every page.'   </em><br />
        Ivan G. Marcus,<strong> Jewish Review of Books</strong></p>
        <p><em>'The current volume is largely based on Grossman's earlier and  very extensive work, but he has succeeded not only in abbreviating it for present  purposes but also in updating various aspects of his impressive scholarship.  The result is a volume that will undoubtedly become the standard work in  English, for use as much (perhaps, in truth, even more) by scholars as by  non-specialists. There is little here that Grossman has not covered . . . his  contribution to the topic goes far beyond the thorough and well-sourced  provision of sound data and careful assessment. He is also able to offer fresh  insights into Rashi the man, the scholar, the rabbi, and the teacher . ..  splendid.</em>'<br />
        Stefan C. Reif, <strong>Journal of Jewish Studies</strong></p>

        <p><em>‘An amazing volume that gives the reader a thorough understanding of who Rashi was through his many writings . . . Grossman’s book is an impressive one . . . very readable, accessible, and fascinating.’</em><br>   Ben Rothke, <strong>Times of Israel</strong></p>

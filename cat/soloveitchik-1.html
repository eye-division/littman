        <span class="author">Haym Soloveitchik</span></p>

    <p>Haym Soloveitchik's principal concern is with stimuli to change in the  unfolding of halakhic ideas. Basing himself here on studies of Rashi  and the Tosafists; usury and money-lending; and the ban on Gentile  wine, he shows how the line between adaptation and deviance is a fine  one, and that where a society draws that line is revelatory of both  its values and its self-perception. A fascinating study in the  development of halakhic thought and Ashkenazi society.</p>

        <p>Written  at different times and for different audiences—some for scholars of  rabbinic literature, some for laymen or for scholars not necessarily  Jewish—the essays gathered together in this volume nevertheless  have an inner coherence. They reflect the author's lifetime  interest in the history of halakhah—not as intellectual history per  se, but rather a concern to identify measurable deflection in the  unfolding of halakhic ideas that could point to an undetected force  at work. What was it that stimulated change, and why? What happened  when strong forces impinged upon halakhic observance, and both the  scholarly elite and the community as a whole had to grapple with  upholding observance while adapting to a new set of circumstances?  Haym Soloveitchik's elegant presentation shows skilfully that the  line between adaptation and deviance is a fine one, and that where a  society draws that line is revelatory of both its values and its  self-perception.</p>
        <p>Many  of the articles presented here are well known in the field but have  been updated for this publication (the major essay on pawnbroking has  been expanded to half again its original size); some have been  previously published only in Hebrew, and two are completely new. An  Introduction highlights the key themes of the collection and explains  the underlying methodology. Having these essays in a single volume  will enable scholars and students to consult all the material on each  theme together, while also tracing the development of ideas.</p>
        <p> The  opening section of the volume is a brief description and  characterization of the dramatis personae who figure in all these  essays: Rashi and the Tosafists. It covers the halakhic commentaries  and their authors; the creativity of Ashkenaz; and the halakhic  isolation of the Ashkenazic community. The second section focuses on  usury and money-lending, including the practice of pawn-broking,  while the third section deals with the ban on Gentile wine and how  that connected to the development of money-lending. The final section  presents general conclusions in the form of four studies of the  communal self-image of Ashkenaz and its attitude to deviation and  change.</p>

    	<p><em>‘The leading contemporary practitioner of the discipline of “History of Halacha” . . . Over the past four decades, he has enriched Jewish scholarship and historiography immeasurably with groundbreaking monographs and books on a broad range of topics . . . [here] the author has updated and significantly expanded his previously published articles . . . should find pride of place on many bookshelves.’</em><br />
Jeffrey R. Woolf, <strong>Jewish Action</strong></p>

		<p><em>‘In our generation the premier practitioner of history of, and through, halacha is Haym Soloveitchik . . . [he], in addition to his many other merits, is an elegant stylist . . . Part of the pleasure of reading him is that there is more learning and illumination to be found in his remarks dropped along the way than in the pages of a lesser scholar . . . profound, poignant essays.’</em><br />

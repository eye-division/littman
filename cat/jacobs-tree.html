      <p>Now revised and expanded, Louis Jacobs's fascinating study shows how halakhic
        rulings through the ages have been influenced by social, economic, theological,
        and even political factors as well as by consideration of the wider ideals
        and demands of Judaism. Halakhic responses to changed social considerations,
        particularly regarding women and questions of personal status, new technologies
      and discoveries, and attitudes to non-Jews are all considered in depth.</p>
      <p><em>'Louis Jacobs demonstrates a profound scholarship in the second edition
        of this important work. The breadth of source and the volume of analysis
        are truly extraordinary.'</em><br />

          <p><em>'Louis Jacobs demonstrates a profound scholarship in the second edition
            of this important work. The breadth of source and the volume of analysis are
            truly extraordinary.</em>' <br />
            Reuven Livingstone, <strong>Jewish Chronicle</strong></p>
          <p>The central thesis of <em>A Tree of Life</em>, now revised and expanded, is
            that social, economic, theological, and even political factors have always played
            a part in framing of Jewish law, as has consideration of the wider ideals of
            Judaism. Through discussion of historical and contemporary halakhic responses
            to a wide range of issues, Louis Jacobs shows how the halakhic system has demonstrated
            its potential for vitality, creativity, and sensitivity.</p>
          <p>Louis Jacobs's call, in the last chapter, for a non-fundamentalist approach
            to halakhah was a cause of controversy both when the book was first published
            in 1984 and subsequently. The new introduction written for this edition responds
            robustly to the criticisms raised, and also summarizes new developments, both
            halakhic and scholarly, in the various areas covered.</p>

          <p>'<em>Rabbi Louis Jacobs is well known as a highly distinguished liberal interpreter
  of Judaism. Many of his works . . . are immediately accessible to the general
  reader, but his interpretation is deeply rooted in scholarly study of the rabbinic
  writings, sources which also inspire &quot;conservative&quot; expressions of a Judaism
  markedly different from his own . . . The author makes his point in a fascinating
  way . . . Vivid light is cast on Jewish-Christian relations among other issues
  . . . Jacobs's book is a fund of valuable information, but its argument is also
  a signal instance of the attachment to tradition embraced with a rational integrity.</em>' <br />

            truly extraordinary.</em>' <br />
            Reuven Livingstone, <strong>Jewish Chronicle</strong></p>
          <p>'<em>It raises questions that still await an adequate response for resolution
            from the Orthodox authorities.</em>'<br />
            Miri Freud-Kandel, <strong>Jerusalem Post</strong></p>
          <p><em>'One of the few works on the nature and development of Jewish law written from a Conservative point of view, and it can be seen as a &quot;classic&quot; . . . Jacobs succeeds in an admirable way in his self-imposed task of developing &quot;a theory of halakhic change for those who are loyal to the halakhic traditions and yet accept modern values&quot;, a task which will probably continue to occupy Conservative and Orthodox thinkers for generations to come.'</em><br />

        <strong>Jerusalem Post </strong></p>
      <p>In this analysis of racialism in late-nineteenth-century France, antisemitism 
        is studied not in isolation but in its social context, as an indicator 
        and symptom of profound social change. As anticapitalism, for example, 
        antisemitism expressed hostility to modern economic forms and 'the rule 
        of money'; as a kind of socialism, it expressed opposition to the establishment 
        without calling the social hierarchy into question; as a kind of nationalism 
        and as racialism, it created a sense of belonging, in opposition to the 
        Jews and to other supposedly alien groups within French society. Other 
        aspects studied in the book are the religious, the sexual, and the cultural 
        and intellectual, in which antisemitism again acted as the vehicle for 
        the expression of the fears inspired by and in reaction to the experience 
        of rapid change, which was seen as a fundamental decadence. Always the 
        supposed action of the Jews supplied an explanation of otherwise inexplicable 
        phenomena. </p>
      <p>Analysis of involvement in the Dreyfus Affair, which dramatized antisemitism 
        and gave it new appeal and legitimacy, and of the antisemitic movement 
        and its activities indicates which social groups were particularly attracted 
        to antisemitism: students, the clergy and Catholics generally, shopkeepers, 
        army officers, members of the liberal professions, and the aristocracy. 
        In each case, particular anxieties and grievances were articulated through 
        a common ideology. There is little evidence that antisemitism was prompted 
        by any experience of actual co-existence with any Jewish communities, 
        except in the east of France; the choice of Jews as scapegoats has, rather, 
        historical and religious explanations. Antisemitism at this time was propagated 
        by 'intellectuals' through newspapers, pamphlets, and books; the new cultural 
        media were used to fashion an abstract ideology from much older folk beliefs. 
        The antisemitic movement of the time had no coherent programme. It did 
        advocate various measures, culminating in extermination, against the Jews, 
        but this was rhetoric, not practical policy.</p>

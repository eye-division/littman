      <p>The  study of Jewish art frequently raises questions relating to Jewish  survival and Jewish identity. These issues have always been of  relevance throughout the Jewish diaspora, and as is evident from the  articles in this volume they continue to concern Jewish artists to  this day.</p>
      <p>The  opening article, 'Illuminations of Kol Nidrei in Two Ashkenazi  Mahzorim' by Sara Offenberg, deals with the hidden meanings expressed  by groups of animals depicted in two medieval Ashkenazi prayer books  for the Day of Atonement. By using allegorical animals in this way  the Jews of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries could safely  express their fear of the hostile Christian society in which they  lived, as well as their trust in God and belief in redemption.</p>
<p>A  surprising link between the Middle Ages and modern times is made by  Rachel Singer&rsquo;s article, 'Maurice Sendak&rsquo;s <em>Where  the Wild Things Are</em>:  An Exploration of the Personal and the Collective'. Published in  1963, this classic children&rsquo;s book, written and illustrated by the  son of a Jewish immigrant family in Brooklyn, is far removed, both  chronologically and geographically, from the Ashkenazi Middle Ages.  In her study, however, Singer prises out hidden sources of  antisemitic perceptions rooted in medieval Christian Europe. This  leads us to the volume&rsquo;s third article, 'The Return of the  Wandering Jew(s) in Samuel Hirszenberg&rsquo;s Art' by Richard I. Cohen  and Mirjam Rajner. The motif of the wandering Jew, a negative and  frightening ﬁgure, is rooted in the late Middle Ages: it made its  first appearance in Christian art, in printed books which  disseminated the Christian legend all over Europe. In the nineteenth  century, Jewish artists engaging with the image of the wandering Jew  endowed it with new interpretations and presentations. One of these  is revealed by the authors as they focus on the painting <em>The  Wandering Jew</em>,  created in 1899 by the Polish Jewish artist Samuel Hirszenberg.</p>
<p>As  is well known, emancipation and the Jewish national awakening in late  nineteenth-century Europe were accompanied by diverse artistic  activities. These included the establishment of Jewish societies  promoting Jewish art and artists, exhibitions, documentation, and  research. Among the most impressive efforts were the activities of  Jewish artists in interwar Poland, recorded in contemporary local  newspapers and periodicals. As these were published in Polish and  Yiddish they weren&rsquo;t accessible to the English-speaking reader,  something that is now rectiﬁed by Renata Piątkowska in &lsquo;A Sense  of Togetherness: The Jewish Society for the Encouragement of the Fine  Arts in Warsaw (1923–1939)'. Based on primary sources, the article  introduces us to the ﬂourishing artistic life which was cruelly  destroyed in the Holocaust.</p>
<p>Another  result of Jewish national awakening, in this case in the medium of  photography, is presented in 'Modernity as Anti-Nostalgia: The  Photographic Books of Tim Gidal and Moshe Vorobeichic and the Eastern  European Shtetl', by Rose-Carol Washton Long. This article examines  how Zionist ideas led two assimilated German-trained photographers to  develop variant thematic and stylistic portrayals of eastern European  shtetls in their photobooks, published in 1931 and 1932. Their  volumes are neither romantic nor nostalgic, but instead convey a  vibrant vision of modernity.</p>
<p>While  the first five articles discuss issues of identity encountered by  Jewish individuals or groups, the next contribution focuses on a  'Jewish identity' that was imposed by a colonial administration.  Dominique Jarrassé's 'Orientalism, Colonialism, and Jewish Identity  in the Synagogues of North Africa under French Domination' ﬁlls the  gaps in our knowledge of synagogue architecture in Tunisia and  Algiers in the modern era in general, and about colonial Orientalism  in particular.</p>
<p>Covert  Jewish identity is revealed by Milly Heyd in 'Hans Richter:  Universalism vis-à-vis Particularism'. This is the third part of her  study of the place of the hidden Jew in the Dada avant-garde, one  part of which is published in volume 1 of <em>Ars  Judaica</em>.  The focus in the present piece is on Hans Richter&rsquo;s art in the  context of Man Ray, Tristan Tzara, and others who were born to Jewish  families but opted for universalism rather than particularism in  their art.</p>
<p> The  Special Item in this year&rsquo;s volume is devoted to a painting by  Moritz Oppenheim that was long thought to be lost. 'Of Provenance and  Providence: On the Reappearance of <em>David  Playing the Harp for Saul</em> by Moritz Oppenheim', by Susan Nashman Fraiman, raises some new and  interesting questions about Oppenheim&rsquo;s early work and patrons. The  study of this painting reveals a conscious effort to incorporate  Jewish source material into his work, an important aspect of his  corpus which has previously been neglected.</p>

        <span class="author">Marc B. Shapiro</span>      </p>
    <p>This
        book takes issue with the widespread assumption that Maimonides' famous
        Thirteen Principles are the last word in Orthodox Jewish theology. The
        author shows that numerous traditional theologians in the last 900 years
        have in fact taken issue with Maimonides' principles, both in their details
        as well as with regard to certain fundamental points in Maimonides&sup1;
    formulation.</p>

            Harvey Belovski, <strong>Jewish Chronicle</strong></p>
          <p>It is commonly asserted that Maimonides' famous Thirteen Principles are the
            last word in Orthodox Jewish theology. This is a very popular notion, and is
            often repeated by scholars from all camps in Judaism. Yet such a position ignores
            the long history of Jewish theology in which Maimonides' principles have been
            subject to great dispute.</p>
          <p>The book begins with a discussion of the significance of the principles and
            illustrates how they assumed such a central place in traditional Judaism. Each
            of the principles is then considered in turn; the reasons underlying Maimonides'
            formulation are expounded and the disputes that have arisen concerning them
            are discussed in detail. Marc B. Shapiro's authoritative analysis makes it quite
            clear that the notion that Maimonides&sup1; principles are the last word in
            traditional Jewish theology is a misconception, and that even Maimonides himself
            was not fully convinced of every aspect of his formulation.</p>
          <p>Although structured around Maimonides' principles, the book can also be seen
            as an encyclopedia of traditional Jewish thought concerning the central issues
            of Jewish theology. The diversity of opinion in Jewish tradition on such issues
            as God, Creation, and the Revelation of the Torah are sure to surprise readers. </p>

          <p><em>'Marc Shapiro puts an explicit contemporary context   on this remarkable collection of sources that disagreed with one part or other   of Maimonides* Thirteen Principles . . . By showing the extent to which past   authors disagreed with those Principles, Shapiro seeks to debunk assertions by   contemporary writers that place those Principles at the core of Orthodox belief   . . . the work is astonishing in its rage. Shapiro uses his daunting   biographical abilities and his considerable skill as a writer to present his   material&lsaquo;well-known and obscure&lsaquo;cogently and entertainingly. To the reader   interested in the limits of the theological imagination of Jews, it is not   likely to be soon rivalled.'</em><br />
Gidon Rothstein, <strong>AJS Review</strong></p>
          <p><em>'Inspiring and breath-taking . . . highly recommended.'</em><br />
            Yisrael Dubitsky, <strong>Association of Jewish Libraries Newsletter</strong></p>
          <p><em>'A courageous and meticulously research book that straddles two worlds&lsaquo;that of abstract scholarship and of practical religious vision . . . The real tour de force of the book is the enormous amount of material he musters to make his case.'</em><br />
            Bradley Shavit Artson, <strong>Conservative Judaism</strong></p>
          <p><em>'Combines remarkable erudition with clarity of vision.'</em><br />

            Harvey Belovski, <strong>Jewish Chronicle</strong></p>
          <p><em>'Ground-breaking . . . As Shapiro so clearly demonstrates in this landmark work, the need is not only for theological discussions, but for theology.' </em><br />
            Miriam Shaviv, <strong>Jewish Quarterly</strong><br />
          </p>
          <p><em>'Shapiro's book is doubly remarkable: it is at the same time a commentary on Maimonides' Thirteen Principles, and a successful summary of the central themes of Jewish theology, offering deep insight into what the blurb calls &quot;traditional Jewish thought&quot;.'</em><br />
            Stefan Schreiner, <strong>Judaica</strong></p>
          <p><em>'Articulate and thought-provoking . . . This book is no less important on social than on scholarly grounds. Shapiro presents his stance with great passion, giving readers the sense that he is involved in a truth spreading mission. His passion appears to me justified and legitimate, since abstract theology is indeed an essential element in the shaping of current Orthodox society, particularly in Israel but also outside it. In sum: this book provides scholars with a justification for a view that most of them had already sensed and accepted and opens up to a broader intellectual public a path to understanding Jewish philosophy.'</em><br />

      <p>Beinart's detailed <em>magnum opus</em> focuses on the practicalities of
        the expulsion and its consequences, both for those expelled and those
        remaining behind. Analysis of hundreds of archival documents enables him
        to take history out of the realm of abstraction and give it concrete reality,
        and in so doing he also sheds much light on Jewish life in Spain before
        the expulsion.</p>

          <p><em>'The most comprehensive study of the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in

            Morris M. Faierstein, <strong>Religious Studies Review</strong></p>
          <p><em>The Expulsion of the Jews from Spain</em> is a detailed study of the events
            surrounding this infamous chapter in Spanish history. Based on hundreds of documents
            discovered, deciphered, and analysed during decades of intensive archival research,
            this work focuses on the practical consequences of the expulsion both for those
            expelled and those remaining behind. It responds to basic questions such as:
            What became of property owned by Jewish individuals and communities? What became
            of outstanding debts between Jews and Christians? How was the Edict of Expulsion
            implemented? What happened to those who converted to Christianity in order to
            remain in Spain or return to that country?</p>
          <p>The material summarized and analysed in this study also sheds light on Jewish
            life in Spain preceding the expulsion. For example, Jews are shown to have been
            present in remote villages where they were not hitherto known to have lived,
            and documents detailing lawsuits between Christians related to debts left behind
            by Jews reveal much about business and financial relations between Jews and
            Christians.</p>
          <p>By focusing on the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in such detail&#8212;for
            example, by naming the magistrates who presided over the confiscation of Jewish
            communal property&#8212;Professor Beinart takes history out of the realm of
            abstraction and places it in the realm of concrete reality, reminding us that
            events were driven by decisions made by real people, and that real people were
            affected by these events.</p>
          <p>From reviews of the Hebrew edition:<br />
            '<em>The importance of this new book lies in its methodical and detailed portrayal
              of the expulsion from Spain in 1492 in all its aspects-political, social, economic,
              legal, and also human. It presents wide-ranging descriptions of the problems
              and the dilemmas facing families and individuals in both large and small communities
              . . . and of how events actually unfolded, day by day and hour by hour. The
              thoroughness of the presentation, documented in every detail, is the product
              of decades of methodical and comprehensive historiographic research covering
              all the areas in which Jews lived in the entire period over which the expulsion
              took place . . . Beinart's historiographic reconstruction gives the contemporary
              reader a palpable understanding of what actually happened.</em>' <br />

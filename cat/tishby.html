        the Zohar in its historical and theological context. . . Every library

            Samuel H. Dresner, <strong>Conservative Judaism </strong></p>
          <p>The Zohar is the fundamental work of Jewish mysticism. Isaiah Tishby's classic
            and definitive <em>Wisdom of the Zohar</em> makes the world of the Zohar available
            to the English-speaking reader in all its complexity and poetry. </p>
          <p>The extended extracts are arranged by topic, each section being prefaced by
            introductory explanations and accompanied by copious notes. There is also a
            General Introduction on the complex symbolism of the Zohar and on its historical
            and literary background. </p>
          <p>The scholarly value of David Goldstein's acclaimed translation is enhanced
            by an index expanded to include references to passages cited in the introduction
            and notes, and by the addition of a subject index and an index of biblical references. </p>
          <p>Isaiah Tishby was awarded the Bialik Prize 1972, the Israel Prize 1979, and
            the Rothschild Prize 1982, mainly for his work on <em>The Wisdom of the Zohar</em>.
            David Goldstein was awarded the Webber Prize 1987 for this translation. </p>

  level, and we never read the Zohar the same way again. . . . Now the splendour
  of the Book of Splendour is available for all to see. The masterful work of
  Tishby has been complemented by a masterful translation by Goldstein. . . .
  This work is a solid step into a substantial and new view of what religion is
  about; it should be a part of every scholarly library, in religion as well as
  in Jewish studies.</em>'<br />

          <p> '<em>. . . extensive and erudite introductions to every section of this magnum
            opus . . . [Tishby's] introductory essays, as well as his annotations to the
            passages in these three volumes, demonstrate his vast erudition and comprehension
            of Kabbalistic theology and literature and thereby introduce the reader into
            the realms of Kabbalah hitherto inaccessible except to a coterie of scholars.
            The comprehensive bibliography, select glossary, an index of references to the
            Zohar, as well as an index of Scriptural references to the texts of this anthology,
            enhance our appreciation of this tour de force which deserves to adorn the bookshelf

            selection of texts from the Zohar thematically arranged and set in the context
            of a systematic exploration of their conceptual background. It is a work greatly
            to be welcomed . . . there has long been a need for such a work. . . . We should
            be grateful to David Goldstein for his decade of labour of love and to Louis
            Littman and the Littman Library for having the courage and commitment to support
            such a task . . . each passage is well-footnoted, the great achievement of this
            project being to provide a guide for the uninitiated to the rich symbolism and
            metaphoric reference of the text . . . There is something immensely rich and
            fertile about the text and texture of the work which has always been of broad
            appeal. . . . David Goldstein's translation reads beautifully. Fortunately,
            he has added additional explanations, when necessary, to the notes . . . There
            can be no doubt that The Wisdom of the Zohar affords the English-speaking reader
            a far deeper entry into the subject than was previously available. . . . This
            translation . . . must place him among the best translators of our time . .
            . The Wisdom of the Zohar is therefore evidence that [Louis Littman's] vision
            of a Library of Jewish Civilization of a standard of excellence will not be
            forsaken.</em>' <br />

          <p> '<em>For over thirty years, Isaiah Tishby's study of the Zohar has been hailed
            as a classic, a landmark in modern Hebrew letters. Beautifully written and deeply
            learned, it has opened the recondite world of the Zohar to more than a generation
            of Hebrew readers. Thus, the appearance of the long-awaited English translation
            is a cause for celebration . . . its mysterious power remains largely intact
            . . . The Zohar . . . is the richest, most imaginative work in the annals of
            Jewish mysticism . . . Tishby's selection of primary sources is exemplary, and
            the commentaries to them, lucid . . . the unusually fine, exacting translation
            . . . the English reader remains in Goldstein's debt. Excellent indices have
            been provided, as well as an updated bibliography. . . . essential reading for
            anyone seeking to plumb critically the depths of the Jewish mystical tradition
            . . . this is a classic about a classic.</em>' <br />
            Elliott Ginsburg, <strong>Journal of Religion</strong></p>
          <p> '<em>Its three-volume English translation now, for the first time, puts the
            Zohar truly at the disposal of students coming from other disciplines concerned
            with religious mysticism who appreciate the importance of treating the Jewish
            material seriously. . . . it is a monumental achievement . . . Goldstein's sensitive
            English version is a great convenience . . . the service to scholarship of the
            Littman Library in making it available.</em>' <br />

        <p><span class="author">Gedalyah Nigal</span><br />
        <span class="translator">Translated from the Hebrew by Edward Levin </span>      </p>
  <p>Story-telling has been an integral part of the hasidic movement  from its inception. Stories about the hasidic leaders and their mystical powers  attracted followers and maintained their devotion, and still do so today. This  important work, based on analysis of all the published anthologies of such  stories, presents them by theme and traces their origins. Originally published  in Hebrew and expanded for this edition, it makes a fascinating contribution to  the history of hasidism, of Hebrew literature, and of Jewish popular culture.</p>

      <p>Story-telling has been an integral  part of the hasidic movement from its very beginnings in the eighteenth century  to the present day. Stories about the holy hasidic leaders&mdash;the tsadikim, or  rebbes&mdash;and their mystical powers have been a key factor in attracting followers  and maintaining their devotion. Such tales were told by the tsadikim and their  followers alike. The tsadikim saw them as a way to promote the movement and  justify their leadership; their followers saw them as a way to exalt their  masters, cleanse them of any shred of imperfection, and defend them from every  trace of criticism. No other social or religious movement in the entire course  of Jewish history has engaged so intensively in the telling of stories, and nor  have stories occupied such a central and important place in any other  intellectual movement within Judaism.<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
        Originally published in Hebrew and  expanded for this English edition by a new introduction, this book is a  valuable resource for anyone interested in the history of hasidism or of Hebrew  literature and the literary aspects of Jewish popular culture. It acts both as  a compendium of stories by theme and as a reference work for the identification  of the subject-matter, authors, editors, and editions of books that have been a  popular Jewish literary genre since the second half of the eighteenth century.  Hasidic tales have been reprinted many times, anthologized, and even quoted by  contemporary scholars, without the identity of their authors or editors being  known, and without any awareness of their background and origin. In this  important work, based on analysis of all the published anthologies as well as  tales scattered in a variety of obscure sources, the author traces the sources  and development of the different stories.</p>
      <p>An introductory historical survey  is followed by full discussions of the stories themselves, grouped by subject.  Among the themes covered are matchmaking and marriages, childbirth and progeny,  sickness, death and the world to come, dybbuks and the powers of evil,  apostasy, and many more.</p>

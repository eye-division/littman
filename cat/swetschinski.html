      <p>Focusing on the social dimension of Amsterdam's Portuguese Jewish economic
        and religious life, Swetschinski paints a lively and unconventional picture
        of the dynamics of a remarkable Jewish community, the first traditional
        Jewish society to engage creatively with the non-Jewish, secular world
        in relative harmony. A broad, authentic, and original vision of the transition
        from medieval to modern Jewish history.      </p>

            Jonathan Israel, <strong>History</strong></p>
          <p>In the seventeenth century, Amsterdam took in several thousand New Christians
            from the Iberian peninsula, descendants of Jews who had been forcibly baptized
            some two hundred years earlier. Shortly after their initial settlement, this
            mostly Portuguese refugee community chose to manifest themselves as Jews again.
            No real obstacles were put in their way.</p>
          <p>The tolerance extended to them by the Amsterdam authorities was as exemplary
            as their new-found commitment to Jewish orthodoxy (barring a few famous instances)
            was strong. These circumstances engendered the new dynamic of a traditional
            Jewish society creatively engaged with the non-Jewish, secular world in relative
            harmony.</p>
          <p>Amsterdam&#8217;s Portuguese Jewry was in this sense the first modern Jewish
            community. Through a fresh and rigorous approach to the documents, Daniel Swetschinki&#8217;s
            lively and original portrait of this justly famous community presents some unexpected
            conclusions. As well as characterizing the major dimensions of the New Christian
            migrations and identifying trends within an array of economic activities, it
            explores the appeal that Judaism as a religion and as a communal structure exercised.
            Throughout, the analysis focuses on the common rather than the exceptional and
            seeks the centre from which the interrelationship of all the constituent parts
            may be grasped.</p>
          <p>Swetschinski&#8217;s emphasis is on the social dimension of Portuguese Jewish
            economic and religious life, formal and informal. He thereby uncovers the internal
            dynamics of this remarkable Jewish community that moulded a renegade New Christian
            population into a model Jewish society, &#8216;model&#8217; in the sense that
            it had the support of proponents of modernity and traditionalism alike and also
            won the respect of the Christian population. His research adds a broad and authentic
            vision to the panoply of images of early modern Jewish history and enables him
            to offer new insights into the troublesome question of the transition from medieval
            to modern Judaism.</p>

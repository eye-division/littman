    <p>In this sequel to <em>We Have Reason to Believe</em>, Louis Jacobs examines
        afresh all the issues involved. He does so objectively but with passion,
        meeting the objections put forward over the past forty years by critics
        from the various trends within the Jewish world, both Orthodox and Reform,
        and inviting a new generation of readers to follow the argument and make
    up their own minds. </p>

          <p>'<em>The most engaging aspect of the book is the personal style in which it

            Emma Conway,<strong> Le'ela</strong></p>
          <p>More than forty years have passed since Louis Jacobs first put forward the
            argument that traditionally observant Jews have no reason to take issue with
            the results obtained by the historical critics in their investigation into the
            Bible and the other classical sources of Judaism. In his numerous works on Jewish
            theology and in lectures worldwide, Jacobs has argued that the traditional doctrine
            which claims that &#8216;the Torah is from Heaven&#8217; can and should be maintained&#8212;provided
            that the word &#8216;from&#8217; is understood in a non-fundamentalist way to
            denote that there is a human as well as a divine element in the Torah: God revealing
            His will not only to but through the Jewish people in their historical experiences
            as they reached out to Him.</p>
          <p>As a result of these views, which were first published in the still-controversial
            text <em>We Have Reason to Believe</em>, the Anglo-Jewish Orthodox hierarchy
            banned Jacobs from serving as an Orthodox rabbi. This was the cause of the notorious
            &#8216;Jacobs affair&#8217;, which culminated in the creation of the New London
            Synagogue and, eventually, in the establishment of the Masorti movement in the
            UK with strong affinities with Conservative Judaism in the United States.</p>
          <p>In this book, Louis Jacobs examines afresh all the issues involved. He does
            so objectively but with passion, meeting the objections put forward by critics
            from the various trends within the Jewish world, both Orthodox and Reform, and
            inviting readers to follow the argument and make up their own minds.</p>

          <p><em>'Jacobs cogently and clearly presents his views on diverse
            topics . . . For all libraries, personal and institutional.</em>' <br />
            Roger S. Kohn, <strong>Association of Jewish Libraries Newsletter</strong></p>
          <p>'<em>Brims with scholarship and is powerfully argued. Jacobs's
            mastery of the full range of Jewish religious sources-legal, philosophical,
            and mystical-is apparent on every page, and is well deployed in making his case
            for liberal supernaturalism as a breakthrough religious synthesis. And that
            case is a timely one, for Jacobs is hardly alone in hungering for a form of
            traditionalism that can combine halakhic observance with an open intellectual
            outlook. Indeed, this is today the shared meeting ground of the right wing of
            Conservative Judaism and the left wing of the Orthodox movement.</em>' <br />

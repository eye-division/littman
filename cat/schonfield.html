        <p><span class="author">Jeremy Schonfield</span>      </p>
  <p>Even those who lavish close attention on talmudic and halakhic writings have rarely studied the Jewish prayer-book. Its dense and apparently impenetrable texts are here subjected to close analysis that exposes the messages and covert concerns implicit in the underlying narrative. The controversial conclusions establish the prayer-book as one of the greatest achievements of Jewish literary creativity. </p>

      <p>Traditional Jews encounter the prayer-book&mdash;the Siddur&mdash;more often in their daily lives than any other text, yet it is mysteriously absent from their otherwise nearly comprehensive curriculum of study. In addition, they tend to recite it mantrically, more for its sound than its meaning. The neglect of meaning is so complete that no edition of the prayer-book has yet appeared with a comprehensive range of commentaries. The present work, the first to examine this paradox, explains it as a reluctance to engage with the intellectual and emotional questions that lie just beneath the surface of the text.</p>
      <p> An analysis of the opening sequences of the daily ritual reveals that the prayer-book, far from representing one side of a deferential dialogue with an attentive deity, actually challenges God to allow access to the revelation on which human safety depends and to keep his side of the covenant. Confronting the chaotic unpredictability of the human condition, this undercurrent of protest allows Jews to question why God's urgently needed intervention seems absent. Anger at this apparent absence is qualified only by gratitude at being alive.</p>
      <p> The core of this book consists of a novel examination of the opening sections of the traditional daily morning liturgy according to the Ashkenazi rite. The analysis is based on mostly untranslated medieval and later commentaries identifying the biblical and rabbinic echoes from which the liturgy is woven, and employs analytical methods of the kind traditionally applied to talmudic and midrashic texts. It shows how each citation and echo imports aspects of its original context into the new composition, forming a countertext to the words on the page. It examines each textual layer, as well as the surface meaning that is usually the only one to be noted, and relates these to the speaker's actual location&mdash;home and later the synagogue&mdash;as well as to the time of day when the prayers are recited, as the worshipper faces the dangers of the day ahead. The resulting chorus of ideas&mdash;linking everyday life to the sacred narrative from creation to exile&mdash;demonstrates the philosophical sophistication of rabbinic spirituality in offering poetic insight into an ultimately tragic vision of reality.</p>

          <p><em>'The Littman Library of Jewish Civilization continues to publish academic works that are not only of the highest scholarly calibre, but are highly readable as well . . . highly recommended for academic and public libraries, as well as synagogues . . .'</em><br />
Daniel Scheide, <strong>Association of Jewish Libraries Newsletter</strong></p>
          <p><em>'Breathtakingly original'&nbsp;</em><br />
            <strong>Cambridge Day Limmud Handbook</strong></p>
          <p><em>'Recommended.' </em><br />
            R. Langer, <strong>Choice</strong></p>
          <p><em>'Schonfield presents pathways of curiosity and  historical/poetical exegesis, as well as multilayered readings—which can raise  the reader's thoughtfulness and delight in the traditional texts of our siddur . . . Readers of this book will appreciate the detail of Littman Library  publications. There is full indexing by topic, as well as extensive indexing of  biblical and rabbinic references. One who adds this beautiful work to a  professional library will also appreciate the very heavy paper and quality  binding that are not so very common these days. This is a serious and  meaningful work, satisfying in its thoughtful and thorough text, and its  physical realization that will stand as an admired reference.' </em><br />
          Robert Scherr, <strong>Conservative  Judaism</strong></p>
<p><em>'A remarkable attempt to explain and analyse the morning prayers . . . provides the reader with a tremendous amount of interesting information.' </em><br />
            Andreas Lehnardt, <strong>European Journal of Jewish Studies</strong></p>
          <p>'The author with impressive  scholarship draws on insights from many different traditions . . . there is no  doubt that it adds a wholly new dimension to our sense of what Jewish prayer,  and possibly every form of prayer, is about.' Fred Morgan, <strong>Gesher</strong></p>
<p><em>'A captivating analysis . . . reading Schonfield will ensure that the Siddur is never read cursorily again.'</em><br />
            <strong>Jewish Book World</strong></p>
          <p><em>'With Undercurrents of Jewish Prayer, Jeremy Schonfield asserts his undeniable right to be accepted into the first rank of Jewish liturgical scholars, as well as achieving the production of a work whose quality and weight would undoubtedly have aroused his esteemed forebears' pride and admiration, as well, just possibly, as anxiety. Schonfield's purpose is to analyse in minute detail the first two sections of the daily liturgy, Birchot Hashachar and Pesukei Dezimra. He does so with a forensic quality that is at times breathtaking for its verve and originality, and its convincing audacity . . . no-one who completes this superb book will be able to look at a prayer book in the same way again. Schonfield sets the tone for his approach in the first three chapters, preparing his reader for an analysis that will be minute, lateral, creative, and highly convincing, as well as informed throughout by the author's broad scholarship . . . a collection of jewels.'</em><br />
            Charles Middleburgh, <strong>Jewish Chronicle</strong></p>
          <p><em>'Challenges the customary devotional attitudes and behaviour of most Jews . . . should establish Jeremy Schonfield . . . as one of the most innovative and unsettling scholars in the world of Jewish studies . . . absorbing and intellectually exhilarating . . . [his] familiarity with Jewish sources is intimate, comprehensive, and meticulous. Not only are arguments penetrating, but his findings often jar with our preconceptions . . . The gains of this heady, bracing exploration of sources of the Jewish quotidian are manifest.</em>'<br />
            Haim Chertok, <strong>Jewish Quarterly</strong></p>
          <p><em>'His comments are rich in data, comprehensible and interesting for a broad   readership, well written and cogently argued . . . The physical production of   the volume is also impressive in many ways . . . readers will undoubtedly find   here numerous insights into the traditional Jewish liturgy . . . we are here   being treated not just to the views of a serious literary critic with a good   knowledge of the scientific and historical study of Jewish liturgy but also to a   very personal expression of devotion that is familial as well as ethnic . . .   we are likely to learn much from the volume and to be deeply grateful to the   author for carefully guiding us into what is often novel, and sometimes even   exciting, territory.'</em><br />
            Stefan C. Reif,<strong> Journal of Jewish Studies</strong></p>
          <p><em>'In many respects, a ground-breaking study which, while aimed chiefly at scholarly readers, raises core questions that should concern the most occasional worshippers as well as the daily devotees . . . Dr Schonfield is too prudent an explorer to suggest a redrawing of liturgical cartography but the contour lines he draws through the daily prayers leave tantalizing possibilities for anyone attempting a modernization of the siddur&lsaquo;or, indeed, a modern translation . . . These structural observations contain, in my view, some of the most valuable of Jeremy Schonfield&sup1;s observations&lsaquo;and if they have to be pursued through a thicket of textual detail, the effort is well rewarded by a multitude of such insights.'</em><br />

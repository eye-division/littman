        <span class="author">Edited by Alex Pomson and Howard Deitcher</span></p>

<p>This  is the first book-length consideration of Jewish day-schools around the world  and of their relationship both to the Jewish community and to society as a  whole. Its cross-cultural and genuinely comparative approach reframes  day-school research in a number of important ways. In consequence it reveals  conflicting conceptions of the social functions of schooling, a new  understanding of the capacity of schools to build community, and original  insights into faith-based schooling and the public good. </p>

          <p>About  350,000 Jewish children are currently enrolled in Jewish day-schools, in every  continent other than Antarctica. This is the  first book-length consideration of life in such schools and of their  relationship both to the Jewish community and to society as a whole. It provides  a rich sense of how community is constructed within Jewish schools, and of how  they contribute to or complicate the construction of community in the wider  society.</p>
          <p>The  volume reframes day-school research in three ways. First, it focuses not just on  the learner in the day-school classroom but sees schools as agents<em> of</em> and <em>for</em> the community. Second, it brings a truly international  perspective to the study of day-schools, viewing them in relation to the  socio-cultural contexts from which they emerge and where they have impact.  Third, it considers day-school education in relation to insights derived from  the study and practice of non-parochial education. </p>
          <p>This  cross-cultural and genuinely comparative approach to the study of Jewish  schooling draws on research from the United   States, the former Soviet Union, South America, and Europe, making it possible to arrive at important and  original insights into parochial Jewish schooling. With contributions from  outstanding scholars as well as practitioners of public education and of Jewish  parochial schooling, the volume reveals conflicting conceptions of the social  functions of schooling and also produces original insights into the capacity of  schools to build community. </p>
          <p>The book is timely in that  it studies questions about faith-based schooling and the public good that today  are as much questions of public policy as they are of academic inquiry. It will  appeal first and foremost to those with a particular interest in Jewish  schooling but will also attract the attention of academics and professionals  concerned with the place of parochial education in contemporary society.</p>

          <p>Leading scholars have combined forces to produce this volume on the philosophy
            and legal views of Moses Maimonides (1138&#8211;1204) and the historical context
            in which he worked. The philosophical section examines Maimonides&#8217; ethical
            doctrine; his paradoxical life-style; his <em>Guide of the Perplexed</em>; his
            attitude to mysticism; his use of language; and his theory of astronomy. The
            legal section deals with law and medicine, the relation of Maimonides&#8217;
            legal thought to the Talmud; his doctrine of a just war; and his theory of redemption
            and Messianism. The history section examines Maimonides&#8217; accession to
            the position of head of the Jewish community in its historical context, at the
            time of the rise of the &#8216;Ayyubid dynasty under Saladin.</p>

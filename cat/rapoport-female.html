<h1>Female Bodies, Male Souls</h1>
        <p><span class="booksubtitle">Asceticism and Gender in the Jewish Tradition</span></span><br />
        <span class="author">Ada Rapoport-Albert</span>      </p>
<p>The 
        world-affirming, normative orientation of Judaism is in conflict with 
        strong ascetic impulses underlying rabbinic tradition. This book explores 
        the gender-related expressions of this conflict. In particular, it discusses 
        why Judaism rejects asceticism for all females yet rigorously endorses 
        it for at least some members of the male elite, and why Jewish women (unlike 
        Christian and Muslim women) have failed to contribute to the tradition 
        of mystical spirituality.</p>

        <div class="CollapsiblePanelContent">
          <p>Judaism has   long been perceived as a world-affirming religion,viewing human beings as a   wholesome unity of body and soul and the material world as the proper arena for   action dedicated to God's service.  Since the body is the instrument through   which this is to be achieved, normative Judaism demands that it be maintained in   good order, and provides, within certain restrictions, for the gratification of   its needs. This is expressed in the injunction to enjoy all permitted pleasures,   and above all in the sanctification of sexuality, the celebration of marriage as   an ideal state, and the rejection of celibacy and   monasticism.</p>
          <p>This   characterization of Judaism first emerged in nineteenth-century Germany   when Jewish historians, engaged as they were in the struggle to enter modern   European society, were keen to promote the image of Judaism as a healthy-minded   religion, strongly differentiated from what was then perceived as the   pathologically ascetic extravagances of Catholic and Eastern Christianity. In   recent years, however, a powerful ascetic impulse has been discerned even at the   very heart of rabbinic tradition, where the notions of the body and sexuality   are fraught with tension. Ascetic self-deprivation&mdash;albeit within the constraints   of Jewish law&mdash;is recognised as an effective way of enhancing mental capacity,   certainly for the intellectual or spiritual elite.</p>
          <p>This book   argues that the problematics of Jewish asceticism have significant gender   implications. It suggests that the traditional ontological distinction between   the sexes and the resultant division of labour are the products of this   unresolved conflict and serve to diffuse some of the tension it generates. The   denial of any value to women's adoption of ascetic practices that may be highly   valued in men is a clear manifestation of this. It further argues that exclusion   from the ascetic life may account for women's apparent failure to contribute to   the mystical tradition of Jewish spirituality, a failure that is particularly   striking given women&rsquo;s important contribution to the mystical traditions of both   Christianity and Islam. Only within the a-nomian or anti-nomian eschatologies of   the heretical Sabbatean movement, which entailed either the spiritualization of   physical reality or the materialization of spiritual realities, as well as the   coming into force of a new messianic Law, could the gender barriers be   eradicated sufficiently to admit women to the ranks of the spiritual elite. The   notion that hasidism effected a proto-feminist revolution in acknowledging a   significant number of women as mystical teachers in their own right is dispelled   as a twentieth-century historiographical myth.</p>

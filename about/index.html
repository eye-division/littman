	<h1>About us</h1>
    <p>'<em>One of the great achievements in contemporary publishing is the Littman
      Library of Jewish Civilization, founded by Louis Littman for the express
      purpose of publishing classic scholarly works which might find it difficult
      to gain the support of commercial presses.</em>' <br />
      Albert H. Friedlander, <strong>European Judaism </strong> </p>
    <p><strong>The Littman Library of Jewish Civilization</strong>, founded by Louis Littman
      in memory of his father to explore, explain, and perpetuate the Jewish
      heritage, published its first book in 1965. In its early years it published
      under the auspices of established houses, most famously Oxford University
      Press. As its list of published titles grew and its reputation developed,
      it became clear that its goals would be better served by publishing independently.
      The Littman Library is now known throughout the world of Jewish studies
      as a leader in the field. </p>
    <p>Littman's academic books are selected for their outstanding scholarship,
      objectivity, and new insights. Many are considered definitive in their
      field. Littman's more general titles, written in an accessible style,
      aim to make important ideas available to a readership concerned with the
      state of the Jewish world. Littman's translations of classic Hebrew works
      let English-speaking readers enjoy a range of exceptional works from the
      Jewish religious and literary corpus. </p>
    <p>The Littman Library's dedication to quality is reflected in its choice
      of books to publish and in the care devoted to each book at every stage
      of its production. Littman has acquired a reputation for publishing books
      of a very high standard, works that are both definitive and well-written. </p>
    <p>Since Louis Littman's death in 1987, his vision has been continued by
      his family, through a charitable foundation. Their involvement in the
      Littman Library's work and support for its objectives provides the strong
      basis upon which Littman builds and develops its founder's legacy and
      maintains his traditions of quality in publishing. Littman is now registered
      as a UK charity, in recognition of its role as a publisher of quality
      books that might not otherwise be commercially viable. Any profits earned
      from the sale of books are all reinvested in the publication of new titles. </p>

    <p>Incorporated in England and Wales; registration number 2448795 </p>
    <p>VAT registration number 596 4881 74 </p>
